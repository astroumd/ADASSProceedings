# ADASSProceedings

We keep the basics of the proceedings for ADASS 2012 and later, as
this is when the ASCL index was first added. This repo includes
material to prepare for authors, as well as for the editors. Each year
will create a different (private probably) github repo,
e.g. ADASSProceedings2018, as was done in College Park, for the actual
proceedings, and from the Author_Template we derive the ADASSyyyy.tar
file with the instructions for the authors.

CAVEAT: we use git branches. The 2018 branch needs to merge to master,
before the 2019 team continue on their own 2019 branch, etc.etc.
