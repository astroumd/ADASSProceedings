"B10-129","Peter Teuben","University of Maryland","How to better describe software for discovery and citation","In this BoF we propose to discuss a variety of items to improve how
software is described and can be discovered. We will invite and
actively search for contributions to this discussion. Some examples of
what we could cover:

1. The codemeta.json file, under control of software
authors. Including a working session to write your own (or base it on
the ASCL starter file). This file (or itâs cousin
CITATION.cff) will also improve software citation, and we will explain
how.

2. Possible options to expand the codemeta file, e.g. keywords
describing the API and its one-liners.

3. Improvements to the Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT) such that
software is better covered.

4. Define a well defined field in astrophysics and take an inventory
of the software used to categorize them. A conference would be an
ideal event to get all the stakeholders together (we have a candidate
for this).

We encourage contributions to this BoF."
"B10-133","Yan Grange","ASTRON","Best licensing practices","In 2016 the FAIR principles, aimed at improving the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets were postulated. Since then the scientific community has been working on interpreting those standards and applying them to their data. 

Among these digital assets, software plays a special role, as software as a tool for data exploitation is diversely used and dynamically developed. Therefore, principles that apply to data can not literally be copied to software, especially in relation to licensing and citation.

During ADASS XXIX it became clear that several groups worldwide are working on formalising the licensing of software and other digital assets. For this session, we will coordinate a discussion focused on what policies and tools help in making software open and accessible, and thus more suited for community reuse."
"B11-143","Jan Noordam","Madroon","BoF: Interoperability of Users, Developers, and Managers","Listening to the presentations of a wide-ranging software survey by
the Radio Camera Initiative (RCI), one message emerges loud and clear:
""We have the algorithms and the tools (e.g. containers etc), but we
are still failing to bring these to bear in such a way that users,
developers and managers are induced to work together effectively"".

This BOF continues a venerable ADASS tradition of offering a platform
to participants for formulating and discussing profound thoughts on
the Future of Astronomical Dataprocessing Software (FADS). In one way
or another, over the years, the FADS discussions have always revolved
around this question. It is perhaps time to put it to rest, if we can.


     Developers (15 min)

There are many clever developers all over the world (cheap too), but
we are not very good at adopting their stuff and integrating it into
our systems.  There are many valid practical reasons for this, but it
slows evolution.

     Users (15 min)

The trend is towards processing pipelines that nobody dares to touch
once they work. This begets ignorant users, and slows evolution. Users
should be able to experiment, and to interact with developers.

     Software Managers (15 min)

Managers should not concern themselves with content. Their role is to
quietly create the conditions in which users and developers can evolve
our systems together.


     Tentative Conclusion (15 min)

The easy answer is that Python already offers many of the things we
need. Users around the globe can easily access a huge variety of high
quality software by means of a single powerful interface (the Python
language). They can combine these into custom recipes (pipelines!),
which they can share with others via email. Very importantly, the
interface disciplines the many developers, while allowing them to
concentrate on whatever they are good at. The Python system is managed
by invisible guardians, and is freely available.

So, is Python sufficient, and can we limit ourselves to writing a few
Python modules of our own? Or do we have to create possibilities which
Python does not provide (yet). In that case we should hope that Python
will eventually adopt the stuff that we develop ourselves.

"B2-73","G. Bruce Berriman","Caltech/IPAC-NExScI","Cost Management on Commercial Cloud Platforms","Commercial cloud platforms are a powerful technology for astronomical research. The Event Horizon Telescope has processed much of its raw data on cloud platforms (Akiyama et al. 2019 - ApJL 875, L1; Kim et al. 2020; A & A, 640, A69 ) The Ice Cube neutrino experiment recently performed a similation experiment with 15,000 GPUs on three cloud platforms. Despite the benefits of cloud computing - such as on-demand scalability, and reduction of systems management overhead - confusion over how to manage costs remains for many one of the biggest barriers to entry, exacerbated by the rapid growth in services offered by commercial providers, and by the growth in the number of these providers. The confuses arises because storage, compute, and I/O are metered at separate rates, all of which can change without notice. As a rule, processing is very cheap, storage is more expensive, and downloading is very expensive. Thus an application that produces large image data sets for download will be far more expensive than an application that performs extensive processing on a small data set.

This BoF aims to quantify the above statement by presenting case studies of the costing of astronomy applications on commercal clouds, covering a range of processing scenarios, including:

- Hosting the Rubin Observatory Interim Data Facility on a cloud platform.
- Creating an all-sky mosaic of TESS survey images.
- Summary of a cost management workshop at IPAC.
- Launching Sci Server on a cloud platform.
- Managing cloud services at STScI

​ Discussion of these and other cases are intended to answer the address the following questions:

- What are the best practices that I can employ for estimating costs?
- How do I pick the best platform for my application?
- How do I take advantage of free or reduced costs services (educators or researchers credits; spot pricing; use an academic cloud...)?
- What are the best practices for optimizing performance and reducing my costs?
- What are the fiscal ""black holes"" that I can fall into?
- Where can I find all this information?

What are those formats, and where are they in the standardization process? We'll have our annual status reports and maybe some new ideas."
"B4-95","Mateusz Malenta","The University of Manchester","It worked on my laptop! - how to approach reproducibility in astronomy?","With large observatories that provide data to thousands of astronomers around the world already online or in the design phase and under construction, it is now more important than ever to approach the problem of reproducibility in astronomy. The last few years have seen a wide adoption of solutions that aim to address some of the reproducibility concerns, such as containers and Jupyter Notebooks. They help to provide a consistent processing environment by, for example, locking users to a single version of Python. This can, however, provide a false sense of security as on the lowest level, these solutions do not take any possible hardware differences into account. On the higher level, the lack of clear software and data format documentation can lead to easily-avoided mistakes. This is especially important in the new era of multi-wavelength astronomy where teams from different backgrounds, using different tools and file formats, come together to solve the same problem.  

Considering all of the above, what do we expect from reproducibility? What are we willing to sacrifice to achieve it (and do we have to sacrifice anything at all?)? Can we as a wider community come together and develop a clear set of guidelines and standards that will ensure the maximum possible reproducibility? If 100% reproducibility is not possible, how can we ensure that all the relevant parties are aware of the possible shortcomings and can include them in their analysis?"

The big questions is how to make (sub-)mm and radio data available to the astronomical community, preferably using FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and re-useable) principles. There are already a lot of efforts going on around the globe: facilities such as ALMA, LOFAR, MWA, NRAO and ASKAP are already publishing much of their data in the form of ""science ready"" image products, SKA regional centres are being formed and a radio astronomy interest group has been initiated within the IVOA. We want to use this BoF to bring everyone interested in this topic around one informal, friendly, virtual table to hear about and discuss the following questions: Where are different groups in their efforts to expose both visibility and science ready data? What is already there, maybe has been used for decades by traditional observatories? Which pieces of information or technology are still missing? Where do we want to go, what needs to happen next?

This BoF will be focused on practical needs for provenance in astronomy. A growing number of projects express the requirement to propose FAIR data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and thus manage provenance information to ensure the quality, reliability and trustworthiness of this data. The concepts are in place, but now, applied specifications and practical tools are needed to answer concrete use cases. We propose to discuss which strategies are considered by your projects (observatories or data providers) to capture provenance in your context and how you consider a end-user might query the provenance information to enhance her/his data selection and retrieval. The objective is to identify the development of tools and formats now needed to make provenance more practical."

A first attempt at defining a common scheme for high-level gamma-ray astronomical data has been initiated by members of different Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT)  experiments with the ""Data formats for gamma-ray astronomy"" forum (https://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).    
The forum, consisting of a series of documentation pages hosted on git, defines specifications to reduce high-level gamma-ray data to lists of candidate photons and instrument response function, stored in FITS files.    
Open-source softwares for gamma-ray analyses have recently developed to support this format and, as a result, a series of publications relying on standardised datasets and software have been recently issued, among them:
- The first public release of H.E.S.S. data (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04516);
- the first reproducible multi-instrument analysis of the Crab Nebula (https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06621);
- an analysis of the H.E.S.S. data with the open-source software ctools (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09456);
- a validation of open-source gamma-ray analysis software employing the same dataset (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08088).

"D1-102","Mario Juric","DiRAC Institute, University of Washington","Checkpoint, Restore, and Live Migration for Science Platforms","We demonstrate and discuss a functional prototype of (per-user) checkpoint, restore, and live migration capabilities for JupyterHub platforms. Checkpointing -- the ability to freeze and suspend to disk the running state (contents of memory, registers, open files, etc.) of a set of processes -- enables the system to snapshot a user's Jupyter session to permanent storage. The restore functionality brings a checkpointed session back to a running state, to continue where it left off at a later time and potentially on a different machine. Finally, live migration enables moving running Jupyter notebook servers between different machines, transparent to the analysis code and w/o disconnecting the user. Our implementation of these capabilities works at the system level, with few limitations, and typical checkpoint/restore times of O(10s) with a pathway to O(1s) live migrations. It opens a myriad of interesting use cases, especially for cloud-based deployments: from checkpointing idle sessions w/o interruption of the user's work (achieving cost reductions of 4x or more), execution on spot instances w. transparent migration on eviction (with cost reductions up to 3x), to automated migration of workloads to ideally suited instances (e.g. moving an analysis to a machine with more or less RAM or cores based on observed resource utilization). The capabilities we demonstrate can make science platforms fully elastic and scalable while retaining excellent user experience."
"D1-66","Oleg Smirnov","Rhodes University & South African Radio Astronomy Observatory","Radiopadre: remote, interactive, zero-admin visualization of data pipeline products","Modern [not only radio] astronomers are coming to terms with being separated from their data and pipelines. Sheer data size alone dictates that data reductions are hardly ever “local” in any sense, but rather have to run on a big node or cluster somewhere remote, with SSH gateways and network latency in between. The new work patterns of the covid-19 pandemic only exacerbate this separation. At the same time, the complexity of new telescopes and pipelines results in a far greater volume and variety of intermediate diagnostics and final data products. The following scenario is becoming familiar: my pipeline run has finished (or crashed), it’s produced 300 log files, 200 intermediate plots, 50 FITS images, and a dozen HTML reports -- on a remote cluster node, which doesn’t even have a basic image viewer installed (and which network lag would have made difficult to use in any case). How do I make sense of all this, without transferring gigabytes of products to my laptop or local workstation first?

Radiopadre (Python Astronomy Data Reductions Examiner, https://github.com/ratt-ru/radiopadre) provides (at least part of) the answer. It is a combination of a client-side script, Docker or Singularity images, a Jupyter Notebook framework, and integrated browser-based FITS viewers (CARTA and JS9) which allows for quick visualization of remote data products. Radiopadre is virtually zero-admin, in the sense that it requires nothing more than a web browser on the client side, an SSH connection, and Docker or Singularity support on the remote end. It allows for both interactive (exploratory) visualization via a Jupyter Notebook, as well as the development of rich, extensive report-style notebooks tuned to the outputs of a particular pipeline.

The demo will showcase the interactive visualization capabilities of Radiopadre, using the output of various MeerKAT imaging pipelines as a working example."

The Python package and supporting API will allow astronomers to retrieve data by simply describing it. For example, consider the statement ""all Galex images within two square degrees of ra=12°34’42”, dec=47°22’52” ”. This description completely and unambiguously defines a known set of data. The Trillian framework will allow one to directly work with data from nothing more than such a description, regardless of where the data is, what interface is required to retrieve it, what files are needed, and what format it is in. The demonstration that can be followed along with will show how multiple data sets can be accessed and how to contribute to the project to add more, plus how this framework is designed to scale from a laptop to a full cloud computing solution. A detailed description of scientific data descriptors will be also presented, a new scheme for addressing data that is one of the components of Trillian but is useful independently outside of the framework. Finally, a brief demonstration will be given of Cornish, a new Python interface around the Starlink AST library that is used to work with regions on a sphere."

Its goal is to provide means ways to make scientific research and programming easier on big datasets coming from simulations ran on HPC clusters (climatic model) or from sensors like observation satellites.

In this demo or talk, we will see how a scientist or an engineer will be able to analyze and process huge data volumes interactively, in a few lines of code, using the software components that are at the heart of Pangeo: Jupyter, Dask and Xarray.

These main pieces of software will be presented:
- Jupyter is the main graphical interface, it advantageously replaces a terminal.
- Dask allows scaling computations and data analysis through many nodes or virtual machines.
- Xarray gives a high level representation of multi-dimensional scientific data.  

We will also describe the main possibilities for deploying a Pangeo platform: your personal laptop, a public cloud provider or an HPC cluster.

Finally, we will demonstrate Pangeo stack usage through some concrete use cases:
- Statistic computations and visualisation of Gaia data catalog.
- A multi-temporal analysis on Sentinel 2 satellite tiles, in order to watch the evolution of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) on its pixels."

"H10-232","William Pence","NASA's HEASARC","CFITSIO - 3 decades of collaborative software development","CFITSIO was originally developed at NASA’s High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC) in 1991 as a simple set of C and Fortran callable subroutines for reading and writing keywords and data arrays in FITS format disk files.  This enabled the HEASARC’s data analysis software to directly process the FITS files in its archive.  Most other astronomical data analysis systems at that time required that FITS format files be imported into a local data format for processing, and the final data products then had to be translated back into FITS format before placing them in the public archive.

The ADASS conferences, which coincidentally also started in 1991, directly led to the development of many major enhancements in the CFITSIO software over the following decades.  This talk will describe some of the collaborations with more than 70 contributors, many of whom have been participants in the ADASS conferences over the years. This provides a good example of the benefits of open source software development."

Today, large investments are on-going to build public Cloud Infrastructure at National or International level (e.g. the European Open Science Cloud Initiative). Also, scientists are approaching commercial and public Clouds at different scales: single researchers test the clouds for small research projects, at the same time large international collaborations are evaluating Cloud technology to collect, process, analyze, archive and curate their data. 
The experience of large scientific instruments in the last years demonstrates how experiments are critically dependent on computing, data processing and storage infrastructures and our ability to utilise them through codes and algorithms.  This will become more and more important with the advent of new class instruments (e.g. SKA, CTA, LSST, EUCLID)  where new computational challenges will be faced. This will lead to the use of new infrastructures where exascale HPC and Clouds will converge to answer new challenges of (Big-) data analysis and (Big-) data analytics (HPDA).
New technologies (e.g. containerization) are driving the convergence of these “worlds” and the advent of science platforms as mean to access data, storage and computing (but also software and algorithms) is facilitating the use of cloud at different scales.

In this talk, I will discuss the actual use of  Cloud in Astrophysics at different scale using some examples and I will present future trends and possibilities that the use of cloud computing and its convergence with HPC will open: from HTC to HPDA, from scientific computing to data analytics."

Now, with new technologies and dedicated survey telescopes, the databases are even growing faster. Besides dealing with poly-structed and complex data, sparse data has become a field of growing scientific interest. By applying technologies from the fields of computer sciences, mathematics, and statistics, astronomical data can be accessed and analyzed more efficiently.

A specific field of research in Astroinformatics is the estimation of the redshift of extra-galactic sources, a measure of their distance, by just using sparse photometric observations. Observing the full spectroscopic information that would be necessary to directly measure the redshift, would be too time consuming. Therefore building accurate statistical models is a mandatory step, especially when it comes to reflecting the uncertainty of the estimates. Statistics and especially weather forecasting has introduced and utilized proper scoring rules and especially the continuous ranked probability score to characterize the calibration as well as the sharpness of predicted probability density functions.

This talk presents what we achieved when using proper scoring rules to train deep neural networks and to evaluate the model estimates. We present how this work led from well calibrated redshift estimates to an improvement in statistical post-processing of weather forecast simulations. The presented work is an example of interdisciplinarity in data-science and how methods can bridge between different fields of application."

We will also discuss what flow files and flow templates are, the role of the Data Flow Manager and how to schedule processors. In addition to that we will show you how to secure site-to-site data transferring and utilise NiFi clustering to balance the load.

For astrophysics and particle physics, initiatives such as ESA Datalabs and ESCAPE aim to offer science data processing and analysis platforms to researchers to help them explore increasingly big data sets generated by space missions and large facilities. In this context there is also a need to provide sophisticated and targeted science data applications to be deployed in different cloud environments.

We will present ongoing inter-linked projects that address this need for cloud-deployed applications for the scientific exploitation of space- and ground-based astrophysics and planetary science data. These projects bring together scientists and engineers from public institutions and private actors and leverage artificial intelligence and human intelligence to provide collaborative, cloud-enabled thematic science applications focussed for the global space science community. Topics include Gaia science, Lunar exploration, data fusion tools for the JWST MIRI instrument, and machine learning tools for selected use cases in planetary science.

Our goal is to deploy containerised Scientific Applications and similar initiatives for uptake by the space science and astrophysics community to discover and exploit new science products in an open and FAIR approach."

Script-based data access provides the ability to make reproducible analysis and pipelines in which the data are retrieved and processed into scientifically relevant results with minimal user interaction, thus astroquery enables the creation of fully reproducible workflows from data acquisition through publication. The package currently consists of over 50 modules that provide direct access to the most commonly used databases, archives and services. While most of the modules share a similar API, they are meant to be used independently. 

astroquery has received significant code contributions from throughout the astronomical community, including both the user community and major archives.

"O1-124","Stefano Alberto Russo","INAF","A microservice-oriented science platform architecture","A Science Platform (SP) is an environment designed to offer users a smoother experience when interacting with data and computing resources. Usually when referring to a SP, we assume a web based environment based on Jupyter notebooks and software containerisation, however also other approaches or definitions of SP may be feasible (e.g. full interactive desktop access).

In current SP architectures, the software available to the user is usually pre-defined and with little or not control by the users. This means that is almost impossible for a user to run a computing task using a specific analysis software (i.e. a specific version, a specific set of dependencies, or just a software not supported by the SP), and that from an administrative prospective there is a strong overhead in supporting the various (yet limited) software versions. 

We tested several approaches to overcome these limitations and we propose a solution based on changing the prospective and framing user task of the SP as microservices - independent and self-contained units. This enables great flexibility, security and sustainability, and empowers the users to choose, build and run their own software environments, which also improves reproducibility.

We successfully used this architecture in the context of the ESCAPE project, at INAF, where we implemented the computing tasks microservices both as Docker and Singularity containers. The first impressions and user feedback are very promising, in particular for interactive desktop applications for data reduction and analysis."

It is traditionally held every year in the fall in a different country, hosted by an astronomy organisation in that country. Or at least this is what has happened for the past 29 editions.

The 30th edition of the ADASS conference series was supposed to take place in Granada, Spain. We were supposed to bask in the sun enjoying southern Spain food and hospitality. Little did we know that our plans had to change dramatically because of a tiny threat with a long name. The ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" has been causing havoc all over the world for a number of months already and has reached pandemic proportions.

It quickly became clear by spring 2020 that our hopes for a quick end to the pandemic were quite naive and that an in-person conference was simply not going to be possible. Not even in November. The ADASS 2020 LOC had to quickly pivot to an online conference format. 

This talk describes in detail all the lessons learned in switching from a relatively advanced traditional conference organisation to an online event. It will hopefully be of use to future organising teams of other online scientific and technical meetings."

The advent of next-generation observing facilities, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), able to map large regions of the sky with unprecedented detail, will result in a data deluge overwhelming the current management and analysis capabilities of the astrophysics community.

In the era of the PB-scale datasets, NEANIAS (Novel EOSC Services for Emerging Atmosphere, Underwater & Space Challenges) emerges as a unique opportunity to tackle the needs of the next-decade astronomy in advance. This ambitious H2020 project foresees the creation of a set of services aimed at boosting astronomers' capabilities in three major fronts: data management and visualization, enabling access to large datasets in a straightforward way under FAIR principles and exploiting novel visualization techniques such as Augmented Reality; map-making and mosaicking, providing workflows to generate large-scale multidimensional maps and fostering multimessenger astronomy; and data analysis supported with Machine Learning techniques, automating the extraction and characterization of compact sources and extended structures from all-sky surveys.

However, the development and deployment of such services represent a substantial scientific and technological challenge, that requires an accurate portrait of the current research landscape in the astrophysics community. With the aim of better understanding the current barriers and needs in space research, we have conducted a survey among astrophysicists and data scientists from several research institutions across Europe, including also the private sector, spanning a wide range of disciplines and expertise levels. In this talk, we will present the preliminary results of the survey, with a particular emphasis on the adoption of Machine Learning techniques and Open Science practices. This research opens a direct communication channel between NEANIAS and the scientific community, providing valuable inputs that will allow us to better tailor the foreseen services to actual research requirements. In this way, we will create a solid foundation to face the astronomical challenges of the next decade."

Architecture and lessons learned with science platform MuseWISE.","Astronomers are data-centric cowboys: they hunt, sometimes unprincipled, for the best-ever calibrated data. 

A key challenge of science platforms is to cater to a community of astronomers that ranges from power-users to novice users. Astronomical power-users have advanced IT skills, know how to navigate archives of databases and bulk dataservers. They want these archives to be interoperable with their own suite of favorite software for data analysis. Power-users have a bi-directional workflow: they want to share through science platforms their improved versions of calibrated data, their subsequent data analysis. They want full data lineage to meet the standard of scientific reproducability.  Novices to data-intensive astronomy know only basic Python/C/sql, need tutorials, intuitive user interfaces and close guidance in  finding, accessing and analyzing calibrated data. They start with a one-directional workflow: downloading final products from static releases in archives. 

With science platform MuseWISE we have 7 years of experience and lessons learned in serving power-users and enabling novices to grow their skills on one science platform.  MuseWISE provides a platform for the Integral Field-Unit spectroscopic data of MUSE at the VLT. The people, databases,  bulk data storages and compute infra for MuseWISE  are spread over seven locations in France, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands.  MuseWISE provides its users a platform for science analysis, data quality assessment, data processing and archive exploration. Power-users contribute and improve both code and data products. They  use their expert knowledge of the information system and its structure. We started an experiment with Jupyter notebooks plus JupyterHub to support the novice that will transition from a consumer to a contributor.   

In this talk we review the data-centric architecture of MuseWISE and its relation to data-centric cowboys. We present the lessons learned in seven years of operations across Europe."

Aladin Lite has been adopted as the sky visualisation component of popular applications: ESA Sky, ESO Science Archive or ALMA Science Archive.

We present a major overhaul of Aladin Lite taking advantage of the GPU with WebGL, and which responds to requests of users, developers and integrators in a context where browser-based applications and science analysis platforms are increasingly important. 

While keeping the strengths of the original code, Aladin version 3 will introduce several new features: support of multiple projections (Aitoff, Mollweide, Orthographic, Mercator), support of FITS tiles, display of FITS images, heatmaps visualisation of catalogue data, improved rendering pipeline and coordinates grids.
We will give an overview on the architecture used to develop these new functionalities, based on existing Rust code transpiled to WebAssembly, a portable high-performance low-level bytecode for the web supported in all modern browsers. We will also outline the technical challenges and limitations we encountered.

"O1-98","Fenja Kollasch","HITS","Interactive exploration framework for big data sets","Astronomy has been a discipline that often suffers from big data issues. Large amounts of data are observed and need to be processed in order to find interesting phenomena. Automatic or semi-automatic approaches are welcome to solve this cumbersome task. In the past, several machine learning methods were proposed to organize, classify, or condense big data sets. However, this is not the end of the road. In most cases, researchers need to take further analysis by hand on automatically preprocessed data to gather valuable conclusions.

To facilitate the pipeline of data analysis, we suggest a generic front-end framework allowing the user not only to process the data automatically, but also to interactively explore and investigate the results of machine learning procedures. A compact visualization gives an initial overview and can be adjusted to point out the parts of interest. By providing abstract accommodation functions such as zooming, scrolling, filtering, and labeling, crucial data fragments can be found and marked in an intuitive way.

We present the prototype UltraPINK in order to demonstrate the idea of such an explorative visualization interface. UltraPINK is a web application to train, store, load, and browse self-organizing Kohonen maps. By using the Parallelized rotation and flipping INvariant Kohonen maps framework (PINK) as a back-end, a clear representation of common shapes in the data set is generated and displayed. The closeup-view of a map shows the generated prototypes and enables different methods to analyse it. Single prototypes can be selected and used to find the data points that resemble this prototype the most. Furthermore, prototypes can be labeled, whereby the given label can be transferred to all similar data points. It is also possible to view and label outliers that do not resemble one of the prototypes. All annotations that have been made to the original data-set are downloadable in various formats.

While our prototype is currently tailored to the PINK back-end specifically, the investigation and labeling functions underlie a generic pattern that can easily be adapted for various kinds of input data and machine learning algorithms. The ultimate goal would be an abstract framework accepting all different data types and algorithms."

Also, and more recently, we have entered what could be called the golden age of surveys, with several large-scale projects, spanning decades, between finished, ongoing, and planned activities. ESA is responsible, or is a major partner, in several of these initiatives.

This change is profound and data has become the major technological challenge. Increases by multiple orders of magnitude in dataset size means that transferring data to a scientist is often unfeasible. But size is only one of the aspects in a data-intensive domain. There are layers of ingestion, curation and analysis happening in parallel and across many communities. Preservation is vital and is, in general, a largely unsolved problem, both in the technology side and in public policy. Finally, curation and analysis also create new challenges that intersect with a push for open science.

We present the current status in the development of the ESA Datalabs platform. This system allows users to bring their code to ESA’s infrastructure and have direct access to ESA’s archives. Datalabs are full computational environments and our catalogue of Datalabs ranges from new tools that have become de-facto standard for analysis, to complex legacy systems repackaged to run via a web browser. ESA Datalabs underlying architecture is domain agnostic; it fosters research and innovation through the integration of transversal access to big data, containerised applications, notebook technologies and domain specific software. For example, customised JupyterLab environments are readily available for astronomers, scientists in Earth Observation related fields, or researchers in global navigation. Moreover, ESA Datalabs support for development environments such as Octave, or reference tools such as TopCat in astronomy enable reusability of existing code baselines.

In the 2020s, astrophysicists might get used to applying for supercomputing time to calibrate, image, and analyze their data, just as naturally as they apply for telescope time.

Python is the standard programming language within the scientific community, with the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) stack the clear reference for data analysis. While parallelizing SciPy code can be relatively straightforward if the algorithm itself is ""embarassingly parallel"" (as in: chunk up the data, ship them to available compute nodes, run the calculations in single-node mode on those chunks), data scientists today are still mostly on their own  when it comes to solving more complex problems, requiring ad-hoc communication among CPUs/GPUs and generally sound HPC training.

The Helmholtz Analytics Framework ([HeAT](https://github.com/helmholtz-analytics/heat)) is meant to bridge this gap. HeAT is an open-source Python tensor library for scientific parallel computing and machine learning. Under the hood, low-level operations and high-level algorithms are optimized to exploit the available resources, be it a dual-core laptop or a supercomputer. At the same time, HeAT's NumPy-like API makes it straightforward for SciPy users to implement HPC applications, or to parallelize their existing ones. HeAT relies on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for its data objects, which implies fast on-process operations and GPU support. Our recent [benchmarks](https://github.com/helmholtz-analytics/heat/tree/master/benchmarks) show that the current early-phase HeAT can achieve a speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude compared to similar Python frameworks.

However, one of the main obstacles to create coordinated observation plans between heterogeneous observatories is the lack of standards. With different wavelength coverage, space or ground based facilities with totally different technical properties, users need tools for fast discovery of metadata and scheduling in a transparent way without expert knowledge on the telescope itself. To address this issue, during the Kavli–IAU Workshop on Multi-Messenger and Transient Astronomy, a white paper was produced identifying as first recommendation on Telescope Coordination the proposal of endorsement by IAU of the IVOA standard on observations planning discovery (Observation Locator Table Access Protocol - ObsLocTAP). Also, a second standard for target visibility by a certain observatory (Object Visibility Simple Access Protocol - ObjVisSAP) is under development by IVOA. By implementing these standards, observatories will allow scientists to discover observation periods when a certain astronomical target is visible for different observatories, identify coordinated observations, discover scheduled observations and to follow-up changes in the scheduling plan. 

We will present the use cases to be solved, the technical description and engineering architecture of the ObsLocTAP and ObjVisSAP IVOA standards designed by this team, the level of implementation of the services by different observatories, client implementations and feedback received from different hands-on workshops and challenges to be solved to implement these protocols.

We present a method to detect these transients based on an artificial neural network. We describe the architecture of two networks capable of comparing images of the same part of the sky taken by different telescopes. One image corresponds to the epoch in which a potential transient could exist; the other is a reference image of an earlier epoch. We use data obtained by the Dr. Cristina V. Torres Memorial Astronomical Observatory and archival reference images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We trained a convolutional neural network and a dense layer network on simulated source samples and tested the trained networks on samples created from real image data. Autonomous detection methods replace the standard process of detecting transients, which is normally achieved by source extraction of a difference image followed by human inspection of the detected candidates. Replacing the human inspection component with an entirely autonomous method would allow for a rapid and automatic follow-up of interesting targets of opportunity. The method will be further tested on telescopes participating in the Transient Optical Robotic Observatory of the South Collaboration."

"O5-36","Kiri Wagstaff","Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology","Machine-Assisted Discovery Through Identification and Explanation of Anomalies in Astronomical Surveys","Data volumes in modern astronomical surveys are large, and human attention is comparatively scarce.  The most interesting sources are rare and may therefore go permanently buried and unknown in large archives.  Moreover, the science results that currently planned surveys propose to deliver (e.g., precise constraints on the physical properties of dark matter and dark energy from Roman, SPHEREx, and Euclid) require exquisitely precise control of systematic errors in measurements taken over billions of individual galaxies and stars. Validating these measurements in current surveys is already a massive undertaking, and existing techniques appear unlikely to scale the next generation of large sky surveys.

We are developing algorithms to enable discovery and validation processes to scale to large survey data sets.  The key innovation is the use of machine learning to identify, group, and explain anomalies within very large data sets.  The goal is to quickly distinguish erroneous measurements and expected patterns in the data from sources and statistical correlations with true astrophysical origins.  We illustrate the process of identifying and explaining anomalies in a study conducted on sources observed by the Dark Energy Survey.  In comparing outliers identified by this process on a subset of the sources (11M) to those that were independently flagged by years of manual review, we found that 96% of the automatically identified outliers were also discarded by humans.  The remaining outliers exhibit some additional issues not previously identified by the team, as well as several unusual objects that led to follow-up spectral observations with the Palomar Observatory.  This approach holds great promise for reducing the amount of manual effort involved in validating large survey data sets and also increasing the rate at which new discoveries are made."

We present a new citizen science project exploring the ESA HST (eHST) archive for serendipitously observed asteroids. Hubble Asteroid Hunter (www.asteroidhunter.org) was set up as a collaboration between scientists and engineers at the ESAC Science Data Centre (ESDC) and Zooniverse and launched on the International Asteroid Day in June 2019. Since then, more than 10,000 volunteers provided 2 million classifications of 150,000 HST images and uncovered 1500 asteroid trails in them, many of the asteroids yet to be identified. Finding the asteroids in HST images allows us to refine the ephemerides of their orbits, as well as to study their orbital distribution. In addition to marking the positions of asteroids, volunteers also tagged satellites in orbits higher than Hubble’s and discovered new strong gravitational lenses and collisional ring galaxies. We argue that a combination of citizen science and artificial intelligence methods is an efficient way of exploring archival data and highlight some of the interesting results found by this project with the invaluable help of the Zooniverse volunteers.

White","Space Telescope Science Institute","The Hubble Image Similarity Project","Archives of astronomical images allow users to find images by metadata: what camera, what filter, what PI, what declination. Catalogs of the objects contained in those images provide a limited search of the data itself: position, magnitude, position angle, Sersic index. In a previous ADASS, we presented how we are harnessing neural networks to answer a much harder question: If I have a complex image, how can I find all the images in the archive that look like it? We found that by using convolutional neural networks trained on terrestrial images and dimensionality reduction techniques, we could find edge-on galaxies with dust lanes, star fields, and rich scenes of star formation.

A major hindrance to our work is the difficulty of comparing algorithms to determine which one is best. At its core the question is whether the groups of images identified by one algorithm are more similar than the groups from another algorithm.  Our new Hubble Image Similarity Project aims to create a large database of similarity information between segments of Hubble images.  The images are compared by humans in a citizen science project, where they are asked to select similar images from a comparison sample.  We also designed the project for community impact: our citizen scientists are service-industry professionals from the local area near STScI in Baltimore who were impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  They are paid a fair wage for their work through the Amazon Mechanical Turk system.

The comparison measurements are analyzed to compute a distance matrix between all the pairs of images, and that distance matrix can subsequently be utilized to assess the accuracy of algorithms based on computer vision methods. The image similarity matrix shows that the collective visual wisdom of our neighbors matches the accuracy of the trained eye, with even subtle differences among images faithfully reflected in the distances.

CICLOPS is a citizen science project designed to transform the search for pulsars into an entertaining 3D video game. 
We take advantage of the best gaming technologies on the market to build a distributed computing platform, running calculations with the user's CPUs and GPUs and using the unique human abilities in pattern recognition to find the best candidate pulsations."

The large field of view of ASKAP means that large areas of the radio sky can be surveyed regularly at sub-millijansky sensitivities. This has not been possible with previous radio telescopes, and means that ASKAP is now providing an unprecedented view of the dynamic radio sky. For example, the first shallow all-sky survey completed by ASKAP provided 2.5 million source measurements. This creates a data challenge for VAST, where regular epochs of the sky will result in the need to construct lightcurves for millions of astrophysical sources, while also being able to swiftly identify the small percentage of sources that exhibit transient behaviour, in addition to providing a visualisation solution for such a large and rich dataset.

We have developed a modern and scalable code base written in Python that builds upon previous software efforts in the community that, due to their old technology stacks, were not scalable to ASKAP datasets. The modern technology stack allows us to perform fast mass source association using Pandas dataframes and well-known Astropy crossmatch functions. The transient detection code and the web interface have been unified under one code base, in which the user can run a pipeline job from both command line and web interface itself.

A database has been used to store the data model, the relationship between entities and to serve data to the web interface. We used Dask, a tool for scalable analytics in Python, as the tool for ensuring both vertical as well as horizontal scalability of the pipeline. The technology stack is: Python 3.6+, Postgres 10+, Astropy 4+, Django 3+, Dask 2+ and Bootstrap 4. The adoption of such a modern technology stack will ensure a long life expectancy of this pipeline.

In this talk we will give an overview of the pipeline architecture and implementation, discuss some initial results, and outline future challenges."
"O8-131","Simon Perkins","South Africa Radio Astronomy Observatory","Distributed Streaming Radio Astronomy Reduction with Dask","From 2010, the biyearly doubling in processor transistor counts predicted by Moore’s Law has slowed, along with the associated increases in single processor speeds. In a bid to offer an edge over competitors, processor manufacturers began offering multiple processors on a single die, leading to the current multi-core processor era. Today, multi-core CPUs are ubiquitous, while the massive performance offered by GPUs is predicated on multi-core programming models and architecture.

While greatly contributing to the ability to process large data volumes, simply adding more cores has proven insufficient to process the sheer quantity of contemporary data, often referred to as “Big Data”. Horizontal scaling, or the use of multiple compute nodes within either HPC or Cloud Computing environments, is routinely used along with strategies such as MapReduce, and cluster computing frameworks such as Spark.

Additionally, the software required to operate in such environments has necessarily changed: While the 1990s and early 2000s advocated Object-Orientated Programming, Big Data leans towards a streaming, chunked, functional programming style with minimal shared state. Consequently, individual tasks handling chunks of data can be flexibly scheduled on multiple cores and nodes. Legacy radio astronomy codes do not readily adapt to this paradigm. To process the quantities of data produced by contemporary radio telescopes such as MeerKAT, and future telescopes such as the SKA using the aforementioned paradigms, radio astronomy codes will need to adapt appropriately.

In this talk we will cover the principles and practices of developing HPC code with Dask, a lightweight Python parallelisation and distribution framework that seamlessly integrates with the PyData ecosystem to address the above challenges. We have found that the intersection of these technologies provides a rich ecosystem for contemporary Radio Astronomy software development. It has already led to a number of diverse packages (covered elsewhere at this conference) at various stages of development and/or release. These include tricolour, xova, shadeMS and QuartiCal."

It will observe an area of 15,000 deg^2 with two instruments, the Visible Imaging Channel (VIS) and the Near IR Spectrometer and imaging Photometer (NISP). Ground based imaging data in griz from surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey and LSST complement the Euclid data to enable photo-z determination. The mission investigates the distance-redshift relationship and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies and clusters of galaxies out to redshifts ~2.

Data processing is done in chunks that cover a specific area on the sky which are called tiles. When dividing a survey sky into tiles certain requirements need to be fulfilled:
* the tiling needs to cover the entire survey area;
* the tile size needs to be manageable by the infrastructure (data bases, storage and computing facilities) and should not create bottlenecks;
* the tiling needs to partition the resulting object catalogs such that each object uniquely exists in only one catalog;

We present the tiling that was developed to cover the Euclid Surveys. Each tile consists of an extended area to compute the object properties and a core area to uniquely associate each object to one tile. The core area is defined in healpix indices and stored as Multi-Order Coverage (MOC) maps. Special tiling is applied for the Euclid Deep Surveys, to have data transfer and computing time within reasonable limit. We also create larger tiles around bright, large galaxies to allow also measuring their properties. We discuss the Euclid tiling in the context of the processing that had been applied in other surveys such as SDSS and 2MASS, among others."

It will hence measure the large-scale structures of the Universe across 10 billion light years, revealing the history of its expansion and the growth of structures during the last three-quarters of its history. In total Euclid will produce up to 26 PB per year of observations. The Euclid Archive System is a joint development between ESA and the Euclid Consortium and is led by the Science Data Centres of the Netherlands and the ESDC (ESAC Science Data Centre). The EAS is composed by three different subsystems: Data Processing System (DPS), Distributed Storage System (DSS) and Science Archive System (SAS). The SAS is being built at the ESDC and is intended to provide access to the most valuable scientific data, which is currently estimated in 10 PB of images, catalogues and spectra, after 6 years mission.

Nowadays, the Astronomy science is inherently interoperable from science data and models perspective but also from the tools and interfaces to exploit them. In this respect, the International Virtual Observatory Alliance, is the organization whose main mission pursues for the data interoperability in Astronomy in which the Euclid Archive has been part of from an early stage. The Euclid Archive was designed to provide interoperability capabilities to enable scientific discoveries on science: images, spectra and a major catalogue of 10 Billion sources. In this paper we will describe how Euclid, supported by its successful precursor Gaia, will make use of the most remarkable IVOA standards (TAP, ObsCore, ConeSearch, SIA, SSA, SODA, VOSpace, DataLink) but also how VO standars are part of the Scientific Platforms ecosystem enabling scientific discoveries to the community."

Already an important part of the research ecosystem, if used properly, containers can shorten development and deployment times and ensure a consistent processing software environment across multiple machines. There is however a significant difference between deploying a web application using Node.js and running a real-time pipeline, as required to process tens of gigabytes of raw data per second. If Docker is not used properly, this can lead to misused and underutilised resources, which are often limited compared to those at the disposal of ‘the industry’. In the worst-case scenario a badly-implemented pipeline can corrupt the data and return incorrect results. 

In this talk I will present lessons learned from developing and maintaining a Docker-based pipeline used as part of the MeerTRAP single-pulse search efforts.  This pipeline is used to run a time-domain search for transients, such as pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts, in the radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Distributed across 65 compute nodes, it consists of multiple stages and overlapping CPU and GPU processing. It makes heavy use of C++ for the initial processing, with the post-processing including candidate classification using machine learning written in Python. I will present the best techniques that we have developed during almost 2 years of developing and maintaining the Docker images for the MeerTRAP project. These include ways to write clean and concise Dockerfiles that result in fast and lean images used for production deployments, reducing the overall size of the Docker ecosystem and maintaining a reliable private repository."

The imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer, SITELLE, at the Canada-France-Hawai’i telescope creates exquisite data cubes with spectral resolution reaching R~10000 and over 4 million spatial pixels. While standard fitting techniques to parse out the kinematic parameters, such as the velocity and broadening of the emission lines, exist, the number of spectra in each cube makes these techniques computationally expensive.

"P10-209","Lexy Andati","Rhodes University","RaGaVi: A Radio Astronomy Gains and Visibilities Inspector","In radio interferometry, the goal of calibration is to mitigate instrumentation and atmospheric effects on observed visibilities, in an attempt to recover the “true” sky. The first step towards calibration is to generate solutions calculated from the observation of sources known as calibrators. These solutions are then applied to the calibrators’ visibilities to gauge their quality. However, inspecting the generated calibration solutions and the effectiveness of their application to the calibrator’s visibilites is paramount to determining the quality of the calibration process. Inspection can be done visually by plotting the solutions or the calibrated visibilities, before applying the solutions to the target source’s visibility data and imaging, to save time and computing resources. The existence of interactive tools for easier identification of faulty data points is advantageous. While there are tools available that offer this functionality, they do not necessarily provide interactive capabilities independent of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Additionally, they may limit the maximum amount of data points that can be plotted due to RAM concerns or protract plot generation for plots involving large amounts of data, as is synonymous with radio-interferometric data presently.

RaGaVi is a python based tool that generates self-contained interactive plots of calibration solutions and visibilities. It has two aspects which perform these tasks, namely ragavi-gains and ragavi-vis, respectively. Ragavi-gains provides interactivity by displaying useful identification information for each data point in calibration solutions (such as scan number, antenna e.t.c.) in addition to other interactive actions. Interactivity is helpful to determine the origin of outliers or problematic solutions quickly. On the other hand, ragavi-vis not only provides some level of interactivity but also presents the capability of processing large volumes of data relatively fast, and with a reduced strain on RAM."

The datasets are made available online via links, which only provide useful information if they adhere to the FAIR principle: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Apart from that, the links need to be permanent which is often hard to achieve. A very common way for making these datasets available, is through Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), which have been widely adopted by publishers and researchers. DOIs also are useful for data use tracking, which helps researchers secure grants and project extensions. 
 
A DOI actually is more than just a link between a publication and a dataset. They also contain a landing page making available metadata for the dataset. This metadata both describes the dataset and facilitates discovery via the Google Dataset Search engine. The Google Dataset Search engine was launched in late January 2020 and already indexes over 25 million datasets. This fast growing service may become the de-facto standard for searching for datasets and new datasets can be made discoverable by adding a JSON script in the DOI landing pages.
 
This presentation focuses on the technical aspects of the implementation of DOIs at the ESDC, the ESAC Science Data Center. The ESDC is in the process of generating DOIs for all space missions and a technical infrastructure is being created to ease the generation of DOIs both for future missions and publications. Given the great number of datasets involved, full automation of DOI generation, including landing pages, metadata and JSON scripts, is on its way at ESDC.

It also implements automatic observation and device parameter logging. The user interface is based on Python and allows for efficient scripted observations.
Due to the generic interfaces, APECS has been able to accommodate all facility and PI instruments during the past 15 years. In recent time many improvements were made to handle the ever increasing data rates and volumes. New calibration schemes can cope with the very wide bandwidths of current and future instruments. APECS was also adapted to use the new wobbler and hexapod of the APEX-II upgrade.
Future developments will address porting the software to Python 3 and migrating the real-time computer to a modern platform."

The scripts are part of the whole observing software, named kosma_software, which controls the communication to the telescope and the instrument backends for consistent operations. kosma_software has been developed since 25 years and its modularity allows it to be used in different observatories and instruments; KOSMA 3m telescope, SMART on NANTEN2, GREAT and FIFI-LS on SOFIA, and it is also planned to be used in the CHAI (CCAT-prime Heterodyne Array Instrument) observations on Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope. The observing scripts are the higher level bash scripts that create a sequence of commands in a fool-safe way and with a full flexibility to modify any parameter on spot. This is especially important in SOFIA observations which has a strict time constraint and the highest efficiency is demanded. We introduce general key features as well as SOFIA specific functions of the observing scripts."

such as star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass and dust luminosity
obtained from
real data using ultraviolet and
infrared observations
to the same parameters obtained from the simulated optical LSST measurements only.
We conclude there is a possible overestimation of SFR, dust luminosity and
dust mass if they are calculated with LSST photometric measurements only.
This overestimation is found to depend on redshift, diminishing up to z = 2.5.
The least sensitive parameter is the stellar mass which was found to
be reliably estimated

"P11-197","Francesco Pistis","National Centre for Nuclear Research (NCBJ)","VIPERS: Fundamental Metallicity Relation and its projections. How observational bias affect their shape","Galaxy metallicity, a result of the integrated star formation history and evolution of the interstellar medium, is an important property describing the galaxy evolution. As such it has been widely studied in the local Universe with the data from the SDSS,
as well as its relations with galaxy stellar mass and SFR. The relation between these three galaxy physical properties, known as Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), was shown not to undergo any significant evolution at least up to z~2. Despite that, different studies find some differences in 2D projections of this relation.
However, these studies are based on very different samples, with different data selection at different redshift ranges. In our work we aim at finding FMR evolution from z~0.6 to z~0, making use of the unprecedented statistics of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Survey (VIPERS) and comparing it to the local SDSS sample. Having that goal in mind, we study the effect of different selection bias introduced into the SDSS sample on both the FMR and its 2D projections. We find significant differences occurring when different data selection, mimicking the selection of higher redshift samples, is applied. Then, we compare these results with the data from the VIPERS sample at z~0.6. We conclude that both FMR and its projection at z~0.6 to z~0 are not in agreement even when the data selection effects are carefully applied. This implies a small but statistically significant evolution of the FMR between z~0.6 to z~0 which needs to be taken into account in future studies."

The affluence of infrared and radio detections of millions of galaxies in the COSMOS field, provided by powerful instruments such as Herschel and ALMA, has allowed us to study dust in galaxies and its variation over a wide range of redshift.
A key element in reproducing the total spectral energy distribution of galaxies, is assuming a dust attenuation law which accounts for the behaviour and the imprints of dust in the ISM. However, different studies have shown that a single law cannot fully model dust in a large sample of galaxies. This non-universality of attenuation laws should be considered in order to accurately account for dust, and therefore in deriving the physical properties of galaxies.
In this work, we study different attenuation laws in a statistical sample of ALMA-detected galaxies in the COSMOS field, and the resulting variation of key physical properties of these galaxies such as the star formation rate, the stellar mass and the dust to stellar mass ratio.
Furthermore, we investigate the dust morphology, as well as the environments of dusty star-forming galaxies, and discuss their effects on the total dust attenuation and the evolution of some of the important physical properties across the cosmic time."

All this information is recorded in text files and stored in a large archive. Individual files are often examined by the observatory personnel for specific issues and for solving well identified problems raised during the night, in the framework of dedicated and focused efforts. Thus, only a minimal part of the information is useful for this kind of daily maintenance.
Nevertheless, the analysis of the archived information collected over a long time span can be exploited to reveal useful trends and statistics about the telescope, which would otherwise be overlooked. Given the large size of the archive, a manual inspection and handling of the logs is cumbersome. An automated tool with an adequate user interface has been developed to scrape specific entries within the log files, process the data and display it in a comprehensible way. This pipeline has been used to scan the information collected over 5 years of telescope activity."

The ALMA Science Archive (almascience.org) serves users with raw observation data, pipeline or manually reduced products including FITS images of science targets, and scripts to restore calibrated MS which is required to create FITS images. Users should execute the script by themselves on their own computers to obtain calibrated MS, since they are not served by the Science Archive. With our new system, users only have to specify the data set and run a command on the provided platform, and the data is ready to go. There is no need to download the data to restore calibrated MS, nor to prepare their own environment for it.

The script requires the same data reduction software (CASA: Common Astronomy Software Applications) including its version with which the product was created. Since there is a strong dependency between the versions of CASA and the operating system (OS), the end of life (EoL) of a certain OS could prevent the users from restoring the MS for ALMA. RedHat Enterprise Linux 6 and equivalents are planned to end their lives in November 2020, which may risk the users who need to restore the data processed with a certain version of CASA with this OS. To overcome this problem, series of CASA distributions tied to shortly obsolete OS are containerized using Docker technology to make them work on more recent versions of OS. As long as the Linux kernel remains backward compatible in the future, the container can be made to work. Keeping the software in a condition to work in the future, it is important to ensure the reproducibility of archived products in the future.

Since April 2020, for the dataset being reduced with previous versions of CASA, East-Asian ALMA Regional Center (EA-ARC) is starting a service to generate and provide the calibrated MS files upon the request from users of ALMA. The system has recently been deployed in EA-ARC to facilitate their operation. Users of ALMA have the benefit of this system through the service provided by EA-ARC."

We present the status of the development of a collaborative web-based portal devoted to cataclysmic variables (CV) research. CVs are binary systems composed of a white-dwarf star and a main-sequence star in a compact configuration that allows mass transfer between the stars. The matter flow is responsible for a plethora of observable variability, among them bright outbursts, which give them the cataclysmic adjective. The first version of the CV portal provides a cooperative catalog of CVs. Currently, the main available CV catalogs are Ritter & Kolb (2003, A&A, 404, 301 - v7.24 - Dec/2015) and Downes & Shara (1993, PASP, 105, 127 - v. Feb/2006), RK and DS, respectively, which are no longer updated. We used the data contained in these 2 catalogs as a seed for the CV Portal catalog. It has 2434 objects: 1361 from RK; 1830 from DS; being 757 objects common to both catalogs. The current version allows the user to inspect (or download) the entire catalog or search for objects by name or coordinates. The object page has direct links to ADS and SIMBAD queries of the object, which helps the user to access, for instance, bibliographic information. The user can also submit new entries to the catalog on a single-object basis by a form or by submitting a CSV file. Those submissions should be approved by one of the CV Portal administrators and, after that, are automatically included in the catalog. We anticipate a large number of CVs discoveries by new instruments as J-PAS, J-PLUS, e-Rosita, and LSST, making this collaborative portal a timely development.

This cluster should state a functional connection between the interested ESFRI projects and the EOSC (European Open Science Cloud) providing tools and solutions according to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles. 
One of the main goal of ESCAPE is the building of ESAP (ESFRI Science Analysis Platform), a flexible and expandable science platform for the analysis of open access data available through the EOSC environment. ESAP will allow EOSC researchers to identify and stage existing data​ ​collections for analysis, share data, share and run scientific workflows.
For many of the concerned ESFRIs and RIs, the data scales involved require significant computational resources (storage and compute) to support processing and analysis. The EOSC-ESFRI science platform therefore must implement appropriate interfaces to an underlying HPC (High Performance Computing) or HTC (High Throughput Computing) infrastructure to take advantage of it. Accessing data and deploying user-initiated processing and analysis tasks on this HTC and HPC infrastructures both in batch mode or maintaining interactivity and responsiveness in the analysis system will be a challenge.

ESAP is designed to be flexible and extensible with a modular structure that encapsulates its different functional components. The ESAP backend is written in Python using the Django framework and communicates with a Javascript frontend via a RESTful API. 

One of the core components of the ESAP is a generic interface that enables discovery of Virtual Observatory (VO) resources by querying the VO registry. Once suitable VO resources have been discovered, ESAP provides a flexible interface to select and retrieve specific subsets of data and stage them for interactive or batch data analysis.

The “Novel EOSC Services for Emerging Atmosphere, Underwater & Space Challenges” (NEANIAS) is an ambitious project that is promoting Open Science practices and is playing an active role in the materialization of the EOSC ecosystem by efficiently engaging large scientific and professional communities, actively contributing to the technological, procedural, strategic and business development of EOSC.  
 
This work presents the NEANIAS activities and first results related to the co-design and delivery of three innovative services, derived from state-of-the-art research assets and practices in the Space research, that mainly includes astrophysics and planetary  science  as  well  as computer  science  and  software  engineering tailored to image processing, computer vision and machine learning. The NEANIAS Space services, namely SPACE-VIS, SPACE-MOS and SPACE-ML, deliver a springboard of tools to enrich the workflows of a wide range of targeted users from academic/research institutions to industrial stakeholders e.g. aerospace engineering and related technological companies, but also national space agencies and public outreach bodies e.g. space museums and planetariums. The SPACE-VIS service provides an advanced operational solution for data management and visualization of astrophysics and planetary data adopting FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable) principles. The SPACE-MOS service provides functionalities for making high quality images from the raw data captured by instruments (map making) and for assembling those images into custom mosaics (mosaicking). Finally, the SPACE-ML service provides advanced solutions for pattern and structure detection in astronomical surveys as well as in planetary surface composition, topography and morphometry. The user requirements collected to guide the software development will be introduced as well as the services delivery processes following the NEANIAS release procedures and the integration into the EOSC platform, finally, the future plans for the next release will be summarized."

"P2-236","Jan-Willem Steeb","National Radio Astronomy Observatory","Implementing a NUFFT in Dask for Radio Astronomy Applications","The Common Astronomy Software Application (CASA) is a widely used radio astronomy data reduction and analysis software package. It has a Python user interface and is implemented in C++ (with some Fortran). CASA has been under continual development for more than 14 years. Consequently, it has become complex and difficult to maintain. To demonstrate that the core functionality of CASA can be successfully re-implemented, the non-uniform FFT (NUFFT) was chosen as a representative function.

A pure Python framework was chosen for this test implementation due to the language's almost ubiquitous use in the astronomy community. One disadvantage of using pure Python is that it is an interpreted language which can be slow relative to compiled languages.  To overcome this limitation we adopt a framework that makes use of the following Python packages: Zarr, Numba, and Dask. Zarr is used to store visibility data as chunked N-dimensional arrays. If code can not be easily vectorized, Numba is used for just-in-time compilation. Concurrency is achieved using the dynamic task scheduling library Dask.

For datasets that can fit into memory Dask NUFFT and CASA NUFFT have similar performance. Dask NUFFT outperforms CASA NUFFT when the visibility data is larger than memory and we demonstrate an appreciable speed-up across a set of data sizes and hardware configurations, potentially indicating more efficient blocked data management using this open-source framework than our tuned custom implementation."
"P2-246","Marcellin","Rhodes University","xova - a Baseline-Dependent Time and Channel Averaging Implementation","Traditional radio interferometric correlators produce regular-gridded samples of the true uv-distribution by averaging the signal over constant, discrete time-frequency intervals. This regular sampling and averaging then translate to be irregular-gridded samples in the uv-space, and results in a baseline-length-dependent loss of amplitude and phase coherence, which is dependent on the distance from the image phase centre: this effect is known as decorrelation. 

In this poster, we discuss the implementation and the theory behind  Xova;  a software package that implements Baseline-Dependent Time and Channel averaging on Measurement Set data. uv-samples along a baseline track are aggregated into a bin until a specified decorrelation tolerance is exceeded. The degree of decorrelation in the bin correspondingly determines the amount of channel averaging that is suitable for samples in the bin. This necessarily implies that the number of channels varies per bin and the output data loses the rectilinear input shape of the input data.

The BDA averaging algorithm used in xova is implemented in the codex-africanus algorithms library via parallel blockwise operations on dask arrays. Each individual operation is accelerated with numba. CASA table columns are exposed as dask arrays by the dask-ms data access library, which also supports writing dask arrays to both existing and new Measurement Sets. As the number of channels varies per bin, xova writes variably shaped data columns to new Measurement Sets. While this is supported by the CASA table system and the MSv2.0 specification, DDFacet is the only imager currently capable of correctly reading these columns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation that can output Time and Channel BDA data to a Measurement Set.

Additionally, care has been taken to ensure that columns are averaged according to their nominal and effective definitions in the MSv2.0 specification. Columns such as TIME and INTERVAL include bad or missing (i.e. flagged) data in a nominal average, while TIME_CENTROID and DATA exclude bad or missing data in an effective average. Thus, fully flagged bins are not merely discarded but are retained so that correct TIME and INTERVAL grids remain established for the downstream applications.

Xova shows a promising compression capability while maintaining decorrelation constant across all the baselines when the BDA option is activated. BDA averaging of data produced by the MeerKAT telescope shows that a data compression factor of 40X and outer field-of-interest suppression are achieved."

Here, we present a data-driven method for isolating the chemical factors of variation in stellar spectra from those of other parameters (i.e. \teff, \logg, \feh). We do this with no knowledge of elemental abundances and hence bypass the uncertainties and systematics associated with synthetic stellar spectra. To remove known non-chemical factors of variation, we develop and implement a neural network architecture, with a disentanglement loss. We simulate our recovery of chemically identical stars in a synthetic APOGEE-like dataset. We show that this recovery declines as a function of the signal to noise ratio, but that our neural network architecture outperforms simpler modeling choices. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of data-driven abundance-free chemical tagging."

While several modern Bayesian codes are routinely used to fit observed photometries with underlying models of star formation, evolution, and dust attenuation, results based on hydrodynamical simulations have quantitatively shown that uncertainties in the derived properties--for example, galaxy mass, star formation history, gas phase dust mass--at a factor of a few level are inescapable. Furthermore, Bayesian fitting is an intrinsically compute-intensive task, often requiring access to expensive hardware for long periods of time. To overcome these shortcomings, we develop 'mirkwood': an explainable, user-friendly tool comprising of an ensemble of supervised machine-learning models capable of mapping galaxy fluxes to their properties. For the first time, we delineate the contribution of each photometric band to galaxy parameters of interest via the use of Shapley values. We also derive both reducible and irreducible predictions errors -- the former refer to uncertainties arising both from missing observations in informative bands and intrinsic noise in observations, while the latter refer to those arising from finite training data and incorrect modeling assumptions. We demonstrate mirkwood's superior performance by training it on a combined data set of z=0 galaxies from SIMBA, EAGLE and ILLUSTRIS-TNG, and comparing the derived results with those obtained from the Prospector.  We envisage mirkwood to be an evolving, open-source framework that will phase out traditional SED fitting."

This coordination is mandatory to understand the nature of these physical phenomena. For this reason, astrophysical projects rely on real-time analysis software pipelines to identify as soon as possible transients (e.g. GRBs), and to speed up external alerts' reaction time. These pipelines can share and receive the science alerts through the Gamma-ray Coordinates Network (GCN).
This work presents a framework designed to simplify the development of real-time scientific analysis pipelines. This framework provides the architecture and the required automatisms to develop a real-time analysis pipeline, allowing the researchers to focus more on the scientific aspects. This work was motivated by developing the real-time analysis of the AGILE satellite focused on the detection of cosmic transients. 
The pipelines developed with this framework can be easily configured with new or existing science tools implemented in different programming languages. The pipelines are able to execute all the analysis automatically after the initial setup. Through the interface with the GCN network, the pipelines are able to react to external science alerts sent by other projects, starting the processing as soon as the instrument data is available. The Slurm Workload Manager is used to execute the scientific analyses in parallel, to manage the priority between different processes and scale the workload on a cluster of machines. All the necessary services are provided to the users by containerization technology. The framework has been successfully used to develop real-time pipelines for the scientific analysis of the AGILE space mission data. It is planned to reuse this framework for the Super-GRAWITA and AFISS projects. A possible future use for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) project is under evaluation."

They are also indispensable records of every single moment of the universe -- a heritage for the human beings. Despite the consensus on their importance, it has been a long-lasting issue to secure human and computing resources for maintaining and improving functionality of the data archives. Recently, the situation has been getting more challenging, as each community is required to accommodate forthcoming big projects within a limited budget frame. To overcome this difficult time, it is quite important to define solid missions of the data archives and consolidate efforts with commitments towards prioritized goals.  Specifically in the Japanese community, we have started to investigate demands and optimal ways of operation for reliable and productive Optical-NIR data archives. Our objectives include to identify 1) what to archive, 2) necessary functions, and 3) roles of individual teams involved in data flow. The current discussion indicates importance of understanding achievements and strengths of the data archives, making data available to public, and defining responsibilities of both data providers and archivers. We aim at putting the results into a proposal of data management in the Japanese community. To learn situations in oversee archives, we also made an unofficial survey for several archive people. It seems that in the US and European archives, stably and successful achievements with archival data have convinced the local community, which leads to proper valuation and financial support. This poster describes the current outcomes from the ongoing discussion."

The method, based on a linear system, is suitable for various background radiation models and here applied from the radio to the far-IR to several types of cosmic microwave background (CMB) distorted photon distribution functions and extragalactic background signals superimposed to the CMB Planckian spectrum.
We derive explicit solutions for the spherical harmonic coefficients up to any desired multipole, lmax, in terms of linear combinations of the signals at just N = lmax + 1 colatitudes. For appropriate choices of these colatitudes, the symmetry property of the associated Legendre polynomials with respect to π/2 allows the separation of the system into two subsystems, one for l = 0 and even multipoles and the other for odd multipoles, and improves the solution accuracy.
The simplicity and efficiency of this method can significantly reduce the computational cost needed for accurate predictions on the whole sky and for the scientific analysis of data from future projects. Moreover, in the presence of CMB spectral distortions, this formalism, combined with the representation of CMB intrinsic anisotropies, provides a new test to constrain the intrinsic dipole embedded in the kinematic dipole."

Currently, the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves observes 78 pulsars with weekly-to-monthly cadence at multiple observatories, thus requiring that our pipelines for processing and building the data set be highly automated. We describe our modernized workflow for the development of new timing models and the software that will (i) allow us to more uniformly develop the data set, (ii) enable students and newcomers in the field to more easily become involved in pulsar timing analyses, and (iii) ensure stringent version control of the software and reproducibility of the data and provide visual accessibility for us and others in the community to verify our results.

To overcome this, we have developed a publicly available convolutional neural network (CNN) called Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet) (http://gamornet.ghosharitra.com/) that classifies galaxies according to their bulge-to-total light ratio. GaMorNet does not need a large amount of real data for training and can be applied to datasets with a range of signal-to-noise ratios and spatial resolutions. We first trained GaMorNet on high-fidelity simulations of galaxies and then transfer-learned using a small amount of real data to achieve misclassification rates of ≲5%. 

We have used GaMorNet to study the quenching of star formation in ∼100,000 (z∼0) SDSS and ∼20,000 (z∼1) CANDELS galaxies using morphology-separated color-mass diagrams. Galaxy morphology adds a third interesting dimension to the color-mass space. Because galactic disks usually do not survive major mergers and elliptical galaxies typically form as a result of merger events, morphology can be used as a tracer for the merger history of a galaxy. Using the GaMorNet classifications, we find that bulge- and disk-dominated galaxies have distinct color-mass diagrams. For both datasets, disk-dominated galaxies peak in the blue cloud, across a broad range of masses, consistent with the slow exhaustion of star-forming gas. In contrast, bulge-dominated galaxies are mostly red, with much smaller numbers down toward the blue cloud, suggesting rapid quenching and fast evolution across the green valley. 

In order to make sure we understand exactly how our algorithm works, we have also used a combination of different CNN visualization techniques to investigate GaMorNet’s decision-making process, making our results interpretable, reproducible and robust."

At the same time, as tracers, they reveal the structure, chemical and dynamic evolution of the galaxy, as well as the substructure of the halo. Compared with other types of stars, RR Lyrae stars are still not enough in number. Therefore, separating RR Lyrae stars from stars belongs to an imbalanced learning problem. It may be solved by popular imbalanced learning methods, which include the distribution change of different samples, improvement of the traditional algorithms and outlier detection methods. Based on large survey databases, we apply imbalanced learning methods (cost-sensitive random forest, cost-sensitive SVM, Fast Boxes) to select RR Lyrae stars candidates. The results showed that imbalanced learning methods are effective for distinguishing RR Lyrae stars from other stars."

The ESA Gaia Archive is a complex infrastructure composed of multiple databases and accessible via Virtual Observatory protocols (see Gonzalez-Nuñez et al, this conference).

It has been devised and developed through the course of nearly a decade. It will evolve to accommodate the large data volumes of the latest releases, in the scale of the Petabyte. User feedback is essential, but sometimes difficult to incorporate in major architecture decisions (front- and back-end, VO, API, code to the data, ...). This is a common feature of many archives, where the popularity of a given service or data set is a-priori unknown.

One possible way forward is asking the users directly, which has been carried out through different surveys. A complementary approach, and the core of this talk, is to analyse the users activity. The Archive traffic monitor statistics and logs have been inspected to look for patterns. For example: GUI vs programmatic access, manual vs computer generated queries, single table vs multiple joins, data volume vs execution time, casual vs power users, etc.

Many archives have a similar architecture or aims (the most immediate example are the Gaia partner data centres), which makes these results relevant for the broad Astronomical community."

However, current and upcoming wide-field time-domain surveys have increased the transient discovery rate far beyond our capacity to obtain even a single spectrum of each new event. We must therefore rely heavily on photometric classification—connecting SN light curves back to their spectroscopically defined classes. Here we present Superphot, an open-source Python implementation of the machine-learning classification algorithm of Villar et al. (2019), and apply it to 2315 previously unclassified transients from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey for which we obtained spectroscopic host galaxy redshifts. Our classifier achieves an overall accuracy of 82%, with completenesses and purities of >80% for the best classes (SNe Ia and superluminous SNe). For the worst performing SN class (SNe Ibc), the completeness and purity fall to 37% and 21%, respectively. Our classifier provides 1257 newly classified SNe Ia, 521 SNe II, 298 SNe Ibc, 181 SNe IIn, and 58 SLSNe. These are among the largest uniformly observed samples of SNe available in the literature and will enable a wide range of statistical studies of each class."

In this work, we report on preliminary results of a chemo-kinematic analysis of a sample of metal-poor stars observed by the GALAH spectroscopic survey.

Galaxy spectra at optical wavelength contain much information of the physical properties such as star-formation rate, stellar mass, metallicity and their history.
Conventional methods of spectral fitting are based on the least chi-square,  Bayesian statistics, etc.
However, these methods require extremely long time and may not be appropriate for a future large spectroscopic survey.
In contrast, a machine-learning based method enables us to perform a spectral fitting much faster than conventional methods. 

Our work investigates the feasibility of this method.
We constructed a neural network to decompose the input spectra into single stellar population (SSP) spectra.
We produced training and test data set using an SSP library (CB07) with various ages, velocity dispersions and dust extinction. 
A 1.0 % Gaussian noise is added both to the training and test spectra in this study. 
We found that our neural network accurately reproduces both the output physical parameters and spectra with  extremely short time, that is, less than one second for 10000 spectra.

However, each survey has a different strategy of target selection, based on individual scientific goals. Diverse target selection results in different statistical distributions of each class of celestial objects in the archive. Therefore, it is not straightforward to reuse a machine-learning algorithm trained on one survey to another due to statistical properties. One of the possible solutions is transfer learning.

Transfer learning is a method which reuses previously gained knowledge in learning a new problem. We present an application of transfer learning in the context of deep learning on the classification of quasars (QSOs), trying to identify unknown QSOs in SDSS archive using the ConvNet model trained on spectra from LAMOST and finally retrained on SDSS spectra. 

We used LAMOST DR5 v3 archive (more than 9 million spectra) and the LAMOST catalogue of all QSOs to discover QSOs unknown to SDSS DR14 QSO Catalog (DR14Q) which corresponds to SDSS DR14 (more than 4 million spectra). For the classification, we employed VGG Net-A ConvNet adapted to one-dimensional spectra.

Applying the ConvNet based on parameters transferred from LAMOST training to our test set of 100 thousand spectra randomly drawn from SDSS resulted in 84330 predicted not-QSOs, 14277 correctly predicted QSOs and 170 missed QSOs. There were also 1223 spectra predicted as QSOs but not identified so in SDSS DR14Q. Our inspection has confirmed a number of the 1223 spectra to be QSOs unknown to SDSS DR14Q. Extrapolating the inspection to 49729 false positives spectra from the whole SDSS DR14 suggest that our ConvNet can discover QSOs not listed in SDSS DR14Q.

This has motivated the application of advanced computer vision techniques such as Deep Learning, which have shown outstanding results in several applications. However, the implementation of these models usually lack a key factor that impedes the incorporation of such models into complex scientific problems that demand large processing times: consideration of speed of inference as a constraint of the problem. To solve this problem, several authors have presented proposals that incorporate tensor layers into the architecture of CNN networks, showing satisfactory results. Following this rationale, we propose Tensor Mask R-CNN, a combination of a state-of-the-art regional convolutional neural network and tensor methods. This novel approach is based on the incorporation of Tensor Layers (T-L), that is, applying tensor decomposition over fully connected layers in the backbone of a Mask R-CNN network. These tensor layers provide more powerful and cheaper parameterizations for fully connected layers. This results in compressed parameter spaces that lead to a reduction in computational costs and, consequently, a reduction in inference time. As a test of our proposal, we apply Tensor Mask R-CNN to the classification of galaxies based on their morphology, where we validate the increase in inference speed, and reduced costs therefore, against the same architecture without tensor layers."

A combination of various state of the art machine learning algorithms is used to develop a fully unsupervised image quality assessment and clustering system. Our pipeline consists of a data pre-processing step where individual image objects are identified in a large astronomical image and converted to smaller pixel images. This data is then consumed by a deep convolutional autoencoder jointly trained with a self-organizing map. The resulting latent data is further compressed using a second autoencoder and eventually mapped onto a two-dimensional grid using a second self-organizing map. We used data taken from ground-based telescopes and, as a case study, compared the system’s ability and performance with the results obtained by supervised methods presented by Teimoorinia et al. (2020). The availability of target labels in a subset of this data allowed a comprehensive performance comparison between our unsupervised and supervised methods. We investigated the accuracy, precision and recall and observed that our unsupervised method outperforms the supervised method in some aspects. In addition to image quality assessments performed in this project, our method can have various other applications. As an example, it can help experts label images in a considerably shorter time with minimum human intervention. It can also be used as a content-based recommendation system capable of filtering images based on the desired content."

For all its faults, CLEAN is remarkable in two regards viz. speed and its ability to accurately model point sources. In this talk, we demonstrate how the same assumptions that afford CLEAN its speed can be used to accelerate more sophisticated deconvolution algorithms. In particular, we approximate the Hessian of the likelihood function as a convolution with the point spread function and use this approximation to develop an effective preconditioner for a proximal gradient based imaging algorithm. The resulting algorithm, dubbed pre-conditioned forward-backward clean (pfb-clean), is implemented using forward-backward iterations and is particularly suited to imaging radio interferometric data in the regime where the data size is much larger than that of the image."

A convolutional neural network is used to classify small ""postage-stamp"" images of candidate detections of astronomical sources into eight classes, followed by a multi-layered perceptron that provides a probability that a temporal sequence of four candidate detections represents a real astronomical source. The goal of this work is to reduce the time delay between Near-Earth Object (NEO) detections and submission to the Minor Planet Center. Due to the rare and hazardous nature of NEOs, a low false negative rate is a priority for the model. We show that the model reaches 99.7% accuracy on an average night of ATLAS detections with a 0.09% false negative rate. Deployment of this model on ATLAS has reduced the amount of NEO candidates that astronomers must screen by 89.1%, thereby bringing ATLAS one step closer to full autonomy."

A complex data analysis is then required to reconstruct the direction, energy and type of the incoming particle from the telescope images.
Since the 2012 ImageNet breakthrough, deep learning advances have shown dramatic improvements in data analysis across a variety of fields. Convolutional neural networks look particularly suited to the task of analysing IACT camera images for event reconstruction as they provide a way to reconstruct the interesting physical parameters directly from calibrated images, skipping the pre-processing steps of standard methods, such as image cleaning and image parametrization. Moreover, despite demanding substancial computing resources to be trained and optimised, neural networks show very good performance during execution. Such a performance proposes neural networks as online analysis tools for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), the  future  generation of IACT that will be one order of magnitude more sensitive than the current generation of experiments.
Here we present a complete reconstruction of IACT events using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The network is then applied in the single telescope context of the LST1, the first CTA telescope prototype built on La Palma's site. We show that the full event reconstruction is possible with a single multi-task network, improving the reconstruction performance by reducing the degeneracy introduced by the monoscopic atmospheric detection. In addition, using a single model reduces the computing needs. The obtained reconstruction performance will be shown and compared to other reconstruction methods."

Observing the magnetoionic media oﬀer insight on to magnetized astronomical objects, such as quasars, galaxies or intergalactic medium in galaxy clusters. The FDF can be obtained by the inverse Fourier transform of the observed linear polarization spectrum. However, the transform gives an insuﬃcient reconstruction of the FDF because the instrument limits the observable wavelength coverage. Up to now, the inability to solve the above inverse problem reliably has noticeably plagued cosmic magnetism studies. Inspired by the well-studied area of signal restoration, we propose the Constraining and Restoring iterative Algorithm for Faraday Tomography (CRAFT). The iterative technique is computationally inexpensive and only initially requires weak physicallymotivated assumptions to produce high ﬁdelity FDF reconstructions. We demonstrate the reconstruction algorithm for a realistic synthetic model FDF of the Milky Way, and the results show that our technique considerably outperforms other popular reconstruction techniques. The spectral dependence on the diﬀerent methods is also demonstrated with a simpler FDF. The proposed approach will be critical for future cosmic magnetism studies, especially with broadband polarization data from the Square Kilometre Array and its precursors."

A recent study by Mondal et al. (2020, ApJ, 895, L39) has provided the first evidence for the presence of ubiquitous impulsive emissions at low radio frequencies from the quiet sun regions. Based on their observed characteristics, the authors find that these emissions, which we refer to as events, meet all of the requirements for being important for coronal heating. From a solar physics perspective, it is very interesting to understand their detailed morphological characteristics. This forms the objective of our study. To put the complexity of the problem in context, we note that in terms of their strength, the weaker features to be studied are about two orders of magnitude weaker than the weakest features reported earlier and are only a few percent of the steady solar emission; in terms of numbers, they occur at a rate of about five hundred events per minute. Based on earlier work with stronger flux densities and theoretical considerations, these features are expected to be compact in the image plane. To characterise the spatial structure of these events, we construct a peak fitting algorithm to find intensity peaks on the Sun, and fit Gaussian or quasi-Gaussian distributions to them. Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN), an unsupervised machine learning algorithm is used to classify the peaks as isolated or clustered. It is also used to obtain robust fits to these peaks, by rejecting noise features, or those that might be contaminated by artefacts from a bright active region present on the Sun. The final objective is to represent the information in the image plane as a set of features that are well-fit with Gaussians. The characteristics of these features can then be further examined to draw conclusions about solar coronal processes. To do a robust statistical analysis, we have applied this tool to a 70 minute dataset with images at every 0.5 seconds at 132 MHz. We present here the preliminary results from our work."
"P5-87","Akio Taniguchi","Nagoya University","Data scientific approaches to efficient sky noise removal in submillimeter single-dish spectroscopy","Removing sky emission from observed data is essential to detect astronomical signals for submillimeter spectroscopy with ground-based single-dish telescopes. The sky emission is intense and dominated by low time-frequency noises. In order to remove it, conventional observing methods based on sky position switch (PSW) alternately obtain spectra at on-source (the sky emission and astronomical signals exist) and off-source (the sky emission only exists) positions. They, however, need to subtract noisy spectra from each other, and results in not only worsening the sensitivity by a factor of √2 but also causing baseline instability in a spectrum, making it difficult to detect faint emission lines such as high-redshift galaxies.

In this talk, we present statistical approaches to remove the sky emission without causing the issues above. By obtaining time-series spectra at a high (>Hz) sampling rate as a data matrix, the sky emission can be instantaneously modeled by low-rank approximation. Meanwhile astronomical signals should be modulated spectrally or spatially so as not to be modeled as a low-rank component. We develop the frequency modulation (FM) method for heterodyne receivers (Taniguchi et al. 2020), and demonstrate that it dramatically improves the sensitivity compared to the PSW observations for point sources by a factor of 1.74. The greater improvement than √2 is because the FM method does not need off-source measurements and thus also improves the on-source time fraction. We also demonstrate that the sensitivity of PSW observations themselves is also improved by a factor of √2 if one could obtain time-series spectra during an observation (Taniguchi et al. in prep). These statistical approaches would be useful for deep spectroscopy driven by future 50-m-class large submillimeter single-dish telescopes in which mechanical PSW becomes difficult."

Our analysis finds 11 AGN with significant evidence of periodicity, of which 9 are identified for the first time.

We use the MeerKAT telescope array in the Karoo desert in South Africa to search for and localise those bursts to high precision in real-time. Our overall aims are to localise FRBs to their host galaxies and, thereby, to understand how they are created. However, the transient nature of FRBs presents various challenges, e.g. in system design, raw compute power and real-time communication, where the real-time requirements are reasonably strict. Namely, our GPU-based software instrument running on the MeerTRAP supercomputer must search the data streams, candidate events need to be clustered and classified, and genuine FRB detections must be communicated to other systems within only a few seconds. These requirements are essential to allow us to retain high-resolution data of the bursts, to localise them to high precision, and to minimise the delay for follow-up observations.

In my talk, I will give a brief overview of the MeerTRAP search instrument and will then focus on how we have implemented real-time triggering capabilities. For that, we utilise standard VOEvents for internal high-resolution voltage data dumps, as well as optical data retention by the co-pointed MeerLICHT telescope. I will touch on how we aim to update FRB localisation parameters, how the instrument could be triggered by external events that are in the field of view of the telescope and how our software ties into external services, such as the IAU transient name server."

Within the IVOA, the Data Access Layer (DAL) Working Group's goal is to provide Recommendations (an IVOA term for the released technical standards) for accessing data collections and catalogues; filtering data holdings based on their metadata; and retrieving the ones in scope, or operating on them.

In recent years the DAL community has addressed the multi-dimensional and multi-wavelength scenarios, and kept core standards up-to-date. It has also tackled new topics such as the observation location and object visibility information retrieval, and looked at older topics such as the outstanding cases of time domain and radio astronomy data.

DAL work in the next few years will involve a mixture of revising existing standards, listening to feedback on recently updated and released standards and the specification of new standards. The DataLink 1.1, DALI 1.2, ADQL 2.1 and ConeSearch 1.1 standards are being revised. The work on these will provide new features requested by the community, updates to match the current technical landscape, and integration of changes from other Recommendations. Other specifications have been recently updated (e.g. TAP 1.1) or are waiting further community feedback before starting a revision process (e.g. SIAP 2.0 and SODA 1.0). New protocols are under development such as the Object Visibility Simple Access Protocol (ObjVisSAP) and the Provenance TAP (ProvTAP) interface. ProvTAP is being managed together with the Data Model Working Group (DM), as is the Observation Locator TAP interface, since they include data model efforts.

Community feedback and contributions are needed for all DAL activities. Particularly important are the experiences of data providers and projects that are using VO technologies to address their scientific community's requirements. This is not a trivial task since the development of a standardised interface for the final user often requires more than one Recommendation to be implemented.

This submission aims to summarise the current DAL status and progress, in order to help new end-users understand how DAL can be beneficial. It also discusses the future changes to DAL standards. Finally, it lists topics (No-SQL, code-to-data, parametric querying, actionable retrieval, ...) worth investigating in the future to keep access layer standardisation up to date with current needs."

However the capabilities of SuperWASP extend beyond exoplanet detection. The SuperWASP photometric archive contains more than 30 million light curves of bright stars (V<15) with a high cadence and long  baseline. A recent reanalysis of the entire archive has detected almost 1.6 million possible unique objects with detectable photometric periodicities on timescales from hours to years (Norton 2018).

The SuperWASP Variable Stars Zooniverse project is using citizen science to classify these 1.6 million light curves. Citizen scientists are asked to classify light curves as simplified variable star types: eclipsing binary stars, pulsating stars, rotationally modulated stars, or simply junk or unknown, and are asked whether the period is correct, incorrect, or half the correct period.

The classification of periodic variables based solely on the shape of the photometric light curve does not always provide a conclusive and unique variable type. However, it can be a good indication of the most likely type and it is useful for identifying interesting candidates which are worth following up.

We present the first data release from the SuperWASP Variable Stars Zooniverse project. It contains over 1 million classifications, corresponding to over 500,000 unique objects. The first data release consists of 4.5% pulsating stars, 5.3% detached eclipsing binary stars, 6.4% contact eclipsing binary stars, 9.9% rotating stars, 7.3% unknown & 66.6% junk. The project was launched on 05 Sep 2018 and has had engagement from ~4500 volunteers to date.

To obtain morphological information one needs to involve people to mark up galaxy images, which requires either a considerable amount of money (in case of MTurk or Toloka commercial engines) or a huge number of volunteers (in case of citizen science projects like Galaxy Zoo). It’s worth nothing that any manual markup at some point becomes ineffective, as it does not scale well for the increasing amount of data.

Today, hybrid approaches (using both machine learning and human markup) make it possible to speed up the galaxy morphology annotation process (e.g. Beck et al. (2018) - SOTA model), but considerable efforts of humans are constantly needed to provide high accuracy of morphological classification. We search for fast and accurate machine classification methods with restricted usage of human markup resources.

We propose an effective semi-supervised approach for galaxy morphology classification task, based on active learning of adversarial autoencoder DNN model. For a binary classification problem (top level question of Galaxy Zoo 2 decision tree) we achieved accuracy 93.1% on the test part with only 0.86 millions markup actions, this model can easily scale up on any number of images.

The core challenges include 1) developing an objective fitness function for quantifying the similarity between model and target images and 2)  understanding the inherent symmetries of the dynamical system which promote morphological degeneracies and impede optimization. In this presentation, we show how naive implementations of fitness functions can yield unintuitive results. We then propose a novel fitness function which was developed by utilizing data from the Galaxy Zoo: Mergers project. These human-scored models were used to validate our fitness functions and led to the adoption of a tidal distortion term which dramatically improved results.

The Python version is dedicated to the rapid prototyping of data quality use cases. The C++ version is optimized for maximum performance. The library allows the user to define, through some XML configuration files, the format of the input data and, for each data field, which quality checks must be performed and which types of aggregations and transformations must be applied. It internally translates the XML configuration into a direct acyclic computational graph that encodes the dependencies of the computational tasks to be performed. This model allows the library to easily take advantage of parallelization at the thread level and the overall flexibility allow us to develop generic data quality pipelines that could also be reused in other applications."

In addition, the sensitivity of SKA will require a new generation of calibration and imaging software to exploit its full potential. The wide-field direction-dependent spectral deconvolution framework, called DDFacet, has already been successfully used in several existing SKA pathfinders and precursors like MeerKAT and LOFAR. However, DDFacet has been developed and optimized for single node HPC systems. DDFacet is a good candidate for being integrated into the SKA computing pipeline and should, therefore, have the possibility to be run on a large multi-node HPC system for real-time performance. The objective of this work is to study the potential parallelism of DDFacet on multi-node HPC systems. This paper presents a new parallelization strategy based on frequency domains. Experimental results with a real data set from LOFAR show an optimal parallelization of the calculations in the frequency domain, allowing to generate a sky image more than four times faster. This paper analyses the results and draws perspectives for the SKA use case."

Hayes","University of California, Irvine","Correcting Inter-Waveband Positional Errors in Sloan Images","The telescope of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS [1]) was designed from scratch to minimize ""down-time"": the telescope does not stop to image a portion of the sky or change filters: instead, images in all 5 wavebands are captured continuously as the telescope moves along a Great Circle on the sky, with all five cameras--one for each waveband--capturing the same area of sky in sequence about 1 minute apart as that region drifts across the camera's field. This is called ""Drift Scan Mode"", and although it maximizes the light captured per unit time, it means that image pixels extracted from the SDSS database do not correspond to physical pixels on the camera, but were instead constructed by a software pipeline that ""tracks"" the sky as it drifts across camera pixels. Unfortunately, this pipeline makes no attempt to ensure that image pixels across wavebands correspond to the same patch of sky. This confounds attempts at cross-waveband comparisons of the same object, since there is no 1-to-1 correspondence
between inter-waveband pixels, and location on the sky.

To solve this problem and reconstruct images for all wavebands that are better suited to precise inter-waveband astrometry, we use the positions of stars visible in any two wavebands to estimate the inter-waveband positional shift. We then use the FITS file to transfer flux between adjacent pixels to construct new images in which the ""same"" pixel corresponds to the same patch of sky across all wavebands. In this abstract we describe the process used to achieve this and quantify the errors in flux and position introduced by our method. The attached image shows an example of an original SDSS image containing a galaxy, the same image shifted half a pixel (which seems to produce worst-case errors), and the residual after a second shift back to the original position. Note that the largest errors occur near stars, whereas the background pixels, and the galaxy, are virtually invisible in the residual image."

In other words, it is nearly impossible to have a completely automated pipeline ready at the time of the official start of science observations unless that start is intentionally delayed to take large amounts of test data and complete the development and testing of the pipeline.

The typical workflow with Filabres consists of the following steps: (1) Image classification (bias, flat-imaging, arc, science- imaging, etc.); (2) Reduction of calibration images (bias, flat-imaging) and generation of combined master calibrations as a function of the modified Julian Date; (3) Basic reduction of individual science images, making use of the corresponding master calibrations (closest in time to the observation of the science target).

The raw outputs of a radio interferometer, i.e. the complex visibility data and all associated metadata, while of little interest to the end-user astronomer per se, contain a wealth of information about the functioning of the instrument and software pipelines, and can provide vital diagnostics during the entire data reduction process. It is therefore important to be able to visualize them in all sorts of ways. However, the sheer size of these datasets (e.g. upwards of a billion measurements for even a short MeerKAT observation) calls for fairly sophisticated plotting techniques that can represent both dense data and outliers, and do it in a reasonable timeframe. This is well beyond the capabilities of our trusted workhorse Matplotlib.

Two recently developed technologies make a solution possible. The Datashader suite (https://datashader.org), driven by Big Data developments in multiple fields, provides functionality for rendering huge datasets onto two-dimensional canvases, using a variety of aggregation and categorization options. The Dask-MS library (https://dask-ms.readthedocs.io, see also Perkins this conf.) provides a native mapping from the Measurement Set, the standard radio astronomy data format, to Dask arrays, which facilitate massively parallel computation (and are natively supported by Datashader).

The shadeMS tool (https://github.com/ratt-ru/shadeMS) brings these two technologies together to allow for the rapid plotting of radio interferometry data. The premise of shadeMS is to support the plotting of anything versus anything, aggregated by anything and coloured (i.e. categorized) by anything, via a straightforward command-line or Python interface. The use of Dask means that a large number of cores can be efficiently exploited, making the plotting process I/O-limited in many cases. This allows data processing pipelines to produce a rich variety of diagnostic plots with relatively little overhead."

The pro
totype, named ASTRI-Horn, is operative, being installed at the INAF observing station located on Mt.Etna (Italy). The ASTRI project includes the building of a Mini-Array of nine ASTRI telescopes that will be installed and operated at the Teide Observatory (Spain). The ASTRI software supports the operations of the ASTRI-Horn prototype and, eventually, of the Mini-Array. 

The data acquisition system of the ASTRI-Horn telescope acquires, packet by packet, the read-out data from the back-end electronics of the ASTRI camera. The packets are then stored locally in one raw binary file as soon as they arrive. During the acquisition, the packets are grouped by data type (scientific, calibration, engineering) before processing and storing the decoded data in FITS format. A quick-look component, running on the same machine, that allows the operator to display the decoded data during the acquisition, was also implemented.

During software testing and operations performed with the ASTRI-Horn prototype, due to a cftisio writing method we experienced a bottleneck in the raw-to-FITS binary data conversion when the acquisition rate was greater than about 3 Mbps. We thus decided to apply a workaround and to postpone the conversion in FITS format of the ASTRI-Horn raw data after the end of the acquisition run. 
 
The ASTRI Mini-Array software requires monitoring the data quality as soon as data are available, and this evaluation is performed by the online observation quality system (OOQS). For this reason, and because the Mini-Array consists of 9 ASTRI cameras observing in parallel, we are evaluating a solution to directly send the decoded data from the data acquisition system to the OOQS, strictly reducing any bottleneck. 

In this paper, we will present a solution to improve the data transfer efficiency from the data acquisition system, based on redis, to the OOQS component of the ASTRI Mini-Array. Results of the comparison between the acquisition software developed for the ASTRI-Horn and this solution based on Redis will be also shown and discussed."

The image reconstruction consists from several steps and transforms irregularly sampled visibilities, which is an amplitude and phase of electromagnetic waves detected by an interferometer, into the intensity of the radio waves at a given location on the sky called sky brightness. The first step in the image reconstruction is the gridding process, where we transform detected visibilities into a regular grid which allow us to use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) instead of direct Fourier transform which is computationally expensive. The sky true brightness is then reconstructed by an iterative process where the brightest sources are deconvolved back to the positions of the irregularly sampled visibilities and subtracted from measured visibilities creating a cleaner image. This is repeated until technique converges. In this work, we have investigated the performance of a part of the 3D deconvolution process which calculates irregularly sampled visibilities from precomputed subgrids on the GPU. The number of visibilities which needs to be calculated can vary greatly by several magnitudes depending on the position in the image and the configurations of the telescope. This variability may cause load balancing issues. We have implemented this using CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs and have achieved performance of 540 million deconvolved visibilities per second."

As part of this process, it is often necessary to build a model of the sky area observed with the Interferometer, and to turn that sky model into a set of model visibilities. The latter step, commonly referred to as prediction of the model visibilities, is computationally expensive.  The model visibilities are generated by the application of the Radio Interferometry Measurement Equation to the sky model, typically represented either as an intensity image or a list of discrete model components. In the former case, faster but less accurate convolutional degridding is applied, while a slower but more accurate Direct Fourier Transform (DFT) is applied in the latter.

The accuracy of the DFT method is required in a number of science cases. An important one is that of spectral-line interferometry. In this case, a continuum sky model must be subtracted from the observed visibilities before making spectral-line images. In practice, frequency-averaged data are used to produce both a continuum image and a component sky model where each component has its own spectral shape. The DFT method takes each component’s spectral shape into account when predicting the model visibilities, allowing one to properly subtract the continuum and thus obtain high-quality spectral-line data. 

Here we present Crystalball, an implementation of the DFT model prediction currently used as part of the CARACal radio interferometry pipeline. In this pipeline, the continuum image and sky model are obtained with WSClean. Crystalball performs a DFT Predict of a Component  Model, using the Python dask and numba packages to accelerate execution. Dask is a parallel processing framework based on computational graphs, while numba jit-compiles a subset of Python code to machine code with performance comparable to C or Fortran. Dask-ms exposes Measurement Set columns as dask Arrays, while the numba code, implemented in the codex-africanus package, is applied to individual chunks of these arrays.

Through the use of these technologies, the expensive DFT has been made tractable on contemporary datasets produced by the MeerKAT telescope. For example, a Measurement Set of 5M rows, 1,000 channels and 2 correlations takes 24 h to predict 10,000 components on an Intel Xeon 2.6 GHz processor with 32 CPUs/threads. All CPU cores are fully exercised during the duration of the prediction step, with modest and tunable usage of RAM. Crystalball has been useful in producing spectral-line data products from recent MeerKAT data (e.g., Serra et al. 2019, A&A, 628A, 122).

While the DFT has been made tractable, Crystalball still consumes a large portion of a CARACal pipeline run. As CARACal currently does not support GPUs, GPU-accelerated prediction as provided by packages such as Montblanc are not feasible. Future work would involve distributing the prediction over a compute cluster or writing a GPU predict should the CARACal pipeline support this processor type in the future."

data-streams go beyond the practical capabilities of traditional long-term data storage and imaging techniques. The Deep Investigations of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) is planning to observe for up to 2,500 hours per field for its deepest survey regions, likely spread over multiple years. As the corresponding raw datasets would be >100PB, and cannot be stored, the default pipeline will form daily images that are then averaged together to create the final deep image data products. This imaging method is severely limited for re-processing to improve final image quality. In particular, small systematic uncertainties, that may be unnoticeable on the daily images, could have a severe impact on the final data products. Therefore, compressed visibility storage is required for post-survey re-processing of the deep data. To meet this need, we developed an alternate DINGO pipeline in which visibilities are stored as a gridded data product. Gridded visibilities are sparse, so can be stored efficiently on a similar level as other compressed visibility formats, such as baseline-dependent averaged visibilities. This method is more than halves the long-term storage cost for the full ASKAP configuration (<30PB) and offers the lowest storage cost for a compact ASKAP configuration using only a subset of 30 antennas (∼5PB). Furthermore, gridding the data in this manner applies the correct kernels, whilst maintaining the ability to flag, reweight or even recalibrate the data. Thus, this approach addresses the greatest risks of the default daily imaging strategy. We present our proof-of-concept pipeline, and we demonstrate that our pipeline introduces no significant systematics as compared to accumulating the daily images. Furthermore, we report on our progress on imaging of DINGO pilot observations."

Recently, the ARI-L project completed successfully its first year review, with the reported activities well ahead of schedule. The first 60000 science FITS files have already been ingested into the official ALMA Science Archive.

The project aims to increase the legacy value of the ASA by bringing the reduction level of ALMA data from Cycles 2-4 close to the level of the more recent Cycles processed with the ALMA Imaging Pipeline. In three years, the ARI-L project will produce and ingest into the ASA a uniform set of full data cubes and continuum images at native spectral resolution and average weighting scheme, covering at least 70% of the observed data from Cycles 2-4. These cubes and images do complement the much smaller archived QA2-generated image products, which cover only a tiny fraction of the available data for those Cycles. The complete set of ARI-L imaging products will be highly relevant for many science-cases and significantly enhance the possibilities of exploitation of archival data."

"P8-90","Andrea Modigliani","European Southern Observatory","The High Level Data Reduction Library","The European Southern Observatory (ESO) provides pipelines to reduce data for almost all Very Large Telescopes (VLT) instruments. In order to reduce the cost of development, verification, and maintenance of ESO pipelines, and at the same time to improve the scientific quality of pipelines data products, ESO develops a limited set of versatile and instrument-independent high-level scientific functions to be used in the pipelines. These routines are provided by the High-level Data Reduction Library (HDRL). HDRL is already used by more than half of the ESO public pipelines with clear benefits on implementation and improved quality of the final data products. HDRL is also used in the core functions of the ESO Toolkit Pipeline (esotk). The latter includes a few recipes to perform stacking of 1D spectra and the detection and correction of fringes on images. Providing HDRL functionality via esotk, instead of using them in a given pipeline, offers some advantages, but also creates a few drawbacks. This talk describes design choices, summarises our experiences implementing HDRL modules and using them in the pipelines, and provides an overview of the different functionalities. Finally, we will focus on a number of recent HDRL improvements."

Such instruments pose the need to integrate advanced data-driven science methodologies for the automatic exploration of huge data archives, and the need for efficient short- and long-term monitoring and diagnostics systems, keeping the quality of the observations under control, and being able to reveal and circumscribe anomalies and malfunctions, facilitating rapid and effective corrections and ensuring correct maintenance of all components over time. In particular, this requirement is crucial for space-borne observation systems, both in logistical and economic terms.
AIDA (Advanced Infrastructure for Data Analysis) is a portable and modular web application, which was created with the aim at providing an efficient and intuitive software infrastructure to support monitoring over time, diagnostics and data analysis of a generic system, particularly suited for astronomical multiple focal plane instruments.
Given its modular system prerogative, it is possible to extend its functionality, by integrating and customizing telemetry monitoring and diagnostics systems, as well as scientific data analysis solutions, which can be based on machine learning and data mining techniques and methods. A specialized version of AIDA has been already used as diagnostic and monitoring service for focal plane instruments of the ESA Euclid mission."

An infrared astronomy legacy treasure","ISO (1995-2001) was an important ESA legacy mission that observed the sky in the infrared wavelength. This satellite performed around 30,000 science observations, including parallel and serendipity modes of the instruments (observational modes in which an instrument could observe while another instrument was prime). Spectral data is still a reference in infrared astronomy and ISO data have special interest these days as it is being used by scientists e.g. to help on the preparation JWST proposals, both because of the energy range that ISO covered and for transient data identification. 

The ISO data archive was the first archive produced at ESAC by the Science Archives Team, using, at that time, powerful technologies like Java Applets and three-tier-architecture. 25 years from is launching, the archive has been reengineered with new technologies, including a powerful user interface (GWT), command line access, Virtual Observatory protocols (SIAP, SSAP, TAP, ObsCore) and, also, an astroquery module to allow the access using astronomical python libraries. This new archive has, also, accurate geometrical queries with detailed footprints that can be displayed on an Aladin Lite visualizer. As part of the user interface capabilities, dynamic visualisation is offered for spectral data (highcharts) and images (js9).

Also, apart from the pipeline data, data processed  by expert users (HPDP - Highly Processed Data Products) can be queried and downloaded from the interface. Finally, publications linked to ISO observations can be also found providing a deep access to all the scientific treasure that this satellite produced."

The information exists in the VizieR database and is made available for the end-user through the VizieR Web pages, the DOI metadata or in the IVOA Registries catalogue record. However, most of the VizieR queries are executed in the Virtual Observatory framework using standards which don't include information like the reference of the article, the authors or the date of publication.

For this reason, we explored the implementation of the recent IVOA Provenance data model in the VizieR context in order to provide the information in a machine readable format. The Provenance model allows to outline the VizieR table curation activity. It specifies data origin, involved actors (persons or institutions) and exposes metadata consumed in the publication workflow : photometric calibration with metadata extracted from remote services, reference article, etc.

"P9-72","Mireille Louys","CDS and ICube Laboratory, University of Strasbourg","Radio Astronomy visibility data discovery and access using IVOA standards","Radio astronomical archives for large facilities (VLA, ASKAP, LOFAR, JIVE, MeerKAT) used to mostly store raw or calibrated visibility data . However, the situation is changing and some facilities (e.g. ALMA), store and distribute science ready data. This will also be the case for future radio telescopes, like SKA, where calibrated and imaged data products will be provided. Naturally, the major goal of these archives is to make their data discoverable and accessible to the astronomy community. Today, many archives give access to visibility data with project-specific web interfaces in order to allow users to reprocess the data with fine tuned reduction parameters. 
Science platforms  such as ESAP developed within the ESCAPE (\footnote{https://projectescape.eu/}) project will allow this.
IVOA decided to make integration of radio astronomy data in the Virtual Observatory (VO) a science priority. Various radio astronomers and projects (NRAO, ASKAP, LOFAR, JIVE, ALMA, SKA, INAF, NenuFAR \footnote{https://nenufar.obs-nancay.fr/en/homepage-en/}, etc.) joined the Radio Astronomy Interest Group of the IVOA, which was recently founded. Together they are paving the way to a better integration of their services in the VO infrastructure and are proposing evolution of IVOA standards to help achieving this goal.

In this context CDS created a prototype for exposing visibility data observations, split in a consistent list of datasets in an ObsTAP service, for coarse grain discovery. Additional metadata such as number of antennae, frequency ranges, uv_density plots, frequency-phase and frequency-amplitude plots, primary and synthesized beams are also provided either by adding column metadata or by using the DataLink technique (\footnote{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/DataLink/}).

This presentation  describes the process of metadata integration in the system, explores how to extend the ObsCore data model specification for radio visibility data and details the choices which have been made. We furthermore show results of data selections through various VO applications. We conclude with the possible evolutions of the prototype and lessons learnt from this exercise.

The project started with the goal to allow the MeerKAT Fornax and MHONGOOSE Large Survey Project (LSP) teams to produce top-quality radio images and data cubes from their raw data in a standardized, easy, and reproducible manner. This goal has now been achieved.

However, CARACal exceeded expectations, in its scope, acceptance, and from an educational point of view. CARACal uses the Stimela containerized pipeline framework (see contribution by Makathini et al. at this conference), which makes it possible to combine the best available (including third-party) software packages into a single pipeline. CARACal is open-source and freely available to not only the LSP teams but anyone who wants to utilise it. It is highly flexible, tunable, and able to reduce data from more than one telescope (uGMRT, JVLA), and it involves scientific analysis steps beyond the mere production of images (to date, source finding and characterisation). Since CARACal is open-source and reiles on containerization technology, any data reduction is transparent and reproducible. The development team involves computer scientists as well as astronomers at various academic levels, from students to professors. This, together with good review strategies, facilitates knowledge exchange on all sides and provides the required feedback to stay user-friendly as well as to sustain an appropriate level of programming style.

In this paper we will discuss the functionality of CARACal, its development structure, including crucial ingredients as well as pitfalls, and discuss future steps to improve its functionality to fully support FAIR principles, in particular interfacing to archives and standardized metadata."
