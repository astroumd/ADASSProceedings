Introduction
============

This package of files is supplied to help you prepare papers for submission in 
the Proceedings for the ADASS 2019 conference held in Groningen, The Netherlands.
Please follow the stepwise instructions below carefully, because the manuscript 
needs to be delivered to ASP in print quality. The more issues are solved early 
on in the process, the more time we all save.

The instructions below are intended to guide you through the process of preparing 
and submitting your contribution. If you need additional help, please see the 
sections at the end of this document. These include more detailed manuals from 
the ADASS editors and ASP, and brief descriptions of the files included in this 
tar package.



STEP 1: Prepare your manuscript
===============================

The best usage is to prepare your paper in this Author_Template directory. If you
author two papers, that will work too, but preparing your tar or zip file is
much easier if you use a parallel Author_Template.

Read the ManuscriptInstructions.pdf file. The ADASS_template.tex file gives you 
a basic template for your ADASS paper. For additional details look in the 
first section of the ASP's "Instructions for Authors and Editors" (manual2010.pdf), 
but note that this is now some years old and current requirements have changed 
slightly. In particular, ADASS papers that cite references MUST supply these 
references in a .bib BibTeX file like the example.bib file provided here.

You will need to run LaTeX on your .tex file, then run BibTeX to process the
references, and then will need to run LaTeX again up to three times to get all
the cross-references right. We recommend that you use the provided Makefile 
(see next subsection), but if you prefer building manually that should work as 
well. ASP does not use pdflatex, so try and stick to latex (we only allow EPS 
figures, not PNG or JPG; see below).

Editing your paper in overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/) is also known to work:
simply upload (as a ZIP file is the easiest) the template, the two asp2014 files,
and optionally your BIB file and EPS figures. Don't start from scratch, or your file
will be likely named main.tex

Optionally in 2019 we have personalized templates, based on your abstract, on
https://www.adass2019.nl/. The instructions within that template are even more 
terse than in ADASS_template.tex , so be warned if some of this material is new 
to you.

Using the provided Makefile
---------------------------

We provide a Makefile to help you build, check and package your paper in the 
correct way. To use it, you need to edit the makedefs file in this directory.
In the makedefs file, you can define the P, V, A, E and FIGS macros, for example:

# Your proceedings paper ID code (the one with the dash, not dot):
P = P13-20

# Your version # (1,2,..) since you can only upload unique files
V = 1

# Your last name, e.g. Teuben
A = Teuben

# Your contact email address for submission issues
E = teuben@gmail.com

# Your EPS figures
FIGS = P13-20_*.eps

Please edit the makedefs file and NOT the Makefile directly. The entries in the
makedefs file will override the ones set in the Makefile. When set correctly,
you should be able to run the following make commands:

    make pdf    : Build the PDF file 
    make check  : Check the manuscript for issues
    make tar    : Build the tar file
    make all    : Do all of the above

Adding subject index entries
----------------------------

It will help the ADASS editors if you add subject index entries for important
terms mentioned in your paper. The Index.py script can help to generate these,
and full details can be found in an appendix in ManuscriptInstructions.pdf.

In your document they should appear a commented \ssindex{} entries, e.g.

   %\ssindex{foobar}

You can also use the following word-cloud type command chain in unix:

    detex $(P).tex | grep -o -E '\w+' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

If your "unix" doesn't have detex, use cat.

Adding ASCL index entries
-------------------------

It will help the ADASS editors if you add ASCL index entries for codes that
you are mentioning in your paper. The ascl.py script can help to generate these,
but it known to give lots of false positives. Nonetheless, you can cut and paste
the correct ones (as a latex comment) in your document, e.g.

   %\ooindex{TOPCAT, ascl:1101.010}


STEP 2: Check your manuscript
=============================

Your paper should typeset without generating any LaTeX errors or warnings. 
Overfull hbox warnings in particular need to be fixed. (In some cases underfull
hbox and vbox warnings may be tolerable.)

The 'make check' command runs a python script which looks for a number of common
problems that have been found in submitted papers. You should run it on your
paper before packaging it up for submission, and should fix any problems it 
finds. This test is a copy of a basic paper checking program that will be run 
by the ADASS editors on all submitted papers.

It is also possible to run the check manually with the PaperCheck.py script. The 
header comments in PaperCheck.py describe how to run it in detail, but essentially 
all you have to do is:

    PaperCheck.py Paper Author

where Paper is the identifier for your paper, eg O10-3 or P8-2 etc, and
Author is the surname of the first author of the paper.


STEP 3: Package and submit your paper
=====================================

You should create a .tar file with a name based on the identifier for your paper and 
including a version number, starting at 1.
e.g. example P10-3_v1.tar. This should contain:

  - The .tex LaTeX file
  - The .bib file defining any cited references
  - And .eps graphics files used by the paper
  - The makedefs file 
  - The resulting .pdf file for the paper, so we can see how you got it.
  - A signed copyright form.

The provided Makefile could help you to build, check and package the paper. 
Make sure that you have edited the makedefs file, where the macros P, A, E, V 
and FIGS should be defined. This makedefs file is automatically included in 
your tar/zip file.

The command to build, check, and package the manuscript is:

      make pdf check tar

(If there are problems typesetting your paper, your copy of the .pdf file for
the paper will at least show the editors what you expected it to look like. If
you have already supplied a paper copy of the copyright form, you do not need
to include this. Note that electronic signatures are not acceptable - sign the
form and scan it.)

https://www.howtogeek.com/164668/how-to-electronically-sign-documents-without-printing-and-scanning-them/

(Zip files are also acceptable, using the same naming convention, e.g. P10-3_v1.zip.)

Submit the paper
----------------

Submit the .tar file as instructed on the ADASS 2019 web site. If you need to
submit a revised version, submit ALL the required files in a new .tar file - do
not just submit the modified files - and append a version number to the name,
e.g. P10-3_v2.tar.

To sum up, here is an example of the files (no directories please) that the editors
like to see:

   P1-2.tex
   P1-2.bib
   P1-2_f1.eps
   P1-2_f2.eps
   makedefs
   P1-2.pdf

you really don't need to send us *any* other type files. Save the electrons!

Github
======

Although each ADASS conference will draw its proceedings preparation package, the original github
repo from which that package is drawn, is available on https://github.com/astroumd/ADASSProceedings
Typically each year will develop the new release on a branch (e.g. "2019" for the Groningen version)
and merge this back to the master for the next year team goes to work.

Authors will not need to know about that, but you may run into some editor specific comments or
commands in the Makefile or the python scripts. 

good luck!
