#  A convenience script to help with processing the submissions for an ADASS
#  ADASS conference. This takes as input two files containing subject index
#  entries in the hierarchical form:
#
#  topic
#     sub-topic
#        sub-topic
#
#  (which is also the form used as input by the ADASS script Index.py) and
#  merges them into a single output file.
#
#  This is something that is worth doing at the end of the editing of a new
#  ADASS volume. Usually the editing process starts with such a file containing
#  the subject index entries used for recent volumes, and ends with a second
#  file that contains the entries used for the current volume (possibly
#  produced using the SubjectEntries2Index script). These can then be merged to
#  form the starting point for the next volume. This helps to keep the subject
#  index entries consistent both between papers in the one volume and from
#  volume to volume.
#
#  Usage:
#     MergeSubjectIndexes FirstInputFile SecondInputFile OutputFile

#  History:
#     15th Jan 2017. Original version.
#     10th Sep 2017. Converted to run under Python3, using 2to3. Added
#                    the importing of items from __future__ to allow this to
#                    run under either Python2 or Python3. KS.
#     22nd Sep 2017. Minor correction to comments about merging lists. KS.
#
#  Python versions:
#     This code should run under either python 2 or python 3, so long as
#     the python 2 version supports the "from __future__ import" used here.
#     It has been tested under 2.7 and 3.6.
